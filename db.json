      "summary": "The parish of Saint Mary in Buenos Aires has been the protagonist of 3 Eucharistic Miracles that occurred in 1992, 1994 and 1996. Professor Ricardo Castañon Gomez was called by the then Archbishop of Buenos Aires, none other than the current Pope Francis, to analyze the Miracle that occurred on August 15 of 1996. This is the account given by Professor Castañon regarding the Eucharistic Miracle that occurred in 1996 still in the Parish of Saint Mary: “On August 15, 1996, a faithful received the consecrated Host in his hands to take communion but he let it inadvertently fall to the ground and thought not to pick it up because it seemed “dirty” to him. Another person, more pious, noticed what had happened, picked it up and placed it apart immediately informing the priest, Father Alejandro Pezet. The priest, following the directives of the Church in these circumstances. put the Host in a vessel full of water which he placed in the tabernacle awaiting that it would dissolve.” “In 2001 I went with my samples to Professor Linoli who identified the white blood cells and said to me that most probably the samples corresponded to heart tissue. The results obtained from the samples were similar to those of the studies performed on the Host of the Miracle of Lanciano. In 2002 we sent the sample to Professor John Walker at the University of Sydney in Australia who confirmed that the samples showed muscle cells and intact white blood cells and everyone knows that white blood cells outside our body disintegrate after 15 minutes and in this case 6 years had already passed.”",
      "text": "In 1992, after the Mass of Friday May 1, while preparing the Eucharistic reserve, a Eucharistic minister found some pieces of consecrated Host on the corporal. Following what the Church prescribes to do in these situations, the priest had them put in a vessel of water, which was then placed in the tabernacle to wait for them to dissolve. In the following days, several priests went to check it and they realized that nothing had changed. Seven days later, on Friday, May 8, they opened the tabernacle and saw that the Host fragments had become a reddish color that looked like blood. The following Sunday, May 10, during the two evening Masses, several small drops of blood were noticed on the patens with which the priests distributed Communion. On Sunday, July 24, 1994, during the children’s Mass, while the Eucharistic minister took the pix from the tabernacle, he saw a drop of blood running along its side. On August 15, 1996, during the Mass of the Assumption of the Most Holy Virgin, a consecrated Host, which fell to the ground during the distribution of Communion, had to be placed again in a vessel of water so it would dissolve. A few days later, on August 26, a Eucharistic minister opened the tabernacle and saw that Host had transformed into Blood. On August 26 the tabernacle was reopened to get the vessel with the fallen Host, and it was observed that it was not dissolved and showed several reddish stains that became larger each day. The priests of the parish went immediately to the Archbishop of Buenos Aires to recount what had happened. It was decided to wait before proceeding with the investigations and in 1999, after the Archbishop was made aware of the fact that I was performing for free these scientific investigations, he entrusted me to take up the case. On October 6, 1999, I went to Buenos Aires and interviewed the 5 priests’ witnesses of the event who told me that there had been another consecrated Host which had bled in May of 1992. They had put it in distilled water which is the worst way to preserve something and for this I was very concerned. Everyone knows that when one draws blood it is possible to obtain the leukocyte formula (white blood cells). In blood there is a variety of white blood cells with specific characteristics. The priests, in the first miracle, had asked one of their lady parishioners who was a chemist to analyze the bleeding Host. She discovered that it was human blood and that it presented the entire leukocyte formula. She was very surprised to observe that the white blood cells were active. The lady doctor could not however do the genetic examination since at that time it was not easy to perform it. I brought a sample from the 2 Hosts which had bled, before the archiepiscopal notary who certified the legality of that action, as requested by the authorities of the Church in Argentina. I would like to point out that before inviting me, the then Archbishop of Buenos Aires had already contacted the Holy See to ask for references about me. These were given by H.E. Most Rev. Gianfranco Girotti, who then was under-secretary at the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and direct collaborator of Cardinal Ratzinger. On October 21 I went to the Forensic Analytical genetics laboratory in San Francisco, which was supposed to perform the analysis of the samples that I had brought. On January 28 of 2000 they found some fragments of human DNA in the samples, it was human blood that contained the human genetic code. In March of 2000 I was informed that also the famous legal histopathologist Dr. Robert Lawrence, one of the top experts in tissues, would participate in this analysis. I feared for the participation of Dr. Robert Lawrence because this would have required some substantial costs which I would have had to bear myself, but I was told that they desired his collaboration because in the samples they had found some substances which resembled human tissues. Dr. Lawrence studied the samples and found in them human skin and white blood cells. In December of 2000 Dr. Lawrence told me that he could have obtained other samples of DNA.” “In September of 2003 I went again to Professor Robert Lawrence who confirmed that in the light of the new investigations one could conclude that the sample could correspond to the tissue of an inflamed heart. The studies therefore had demonstrated that these tissues were of an inflamed heart: this meant that the person to whom they belonged must have suffered a lot. To clarify our doubts, on March 2, 2004 we went to the greatest expert in cardiac pathologies and forensic medicine of the heart, Professor Frederick Zugibe of New York, at Columbia University. The professor however did not know that the sample I had brought to him came from a consecrated Host. ‘The sample which you brought me - Professor Zugibe said to me - is the muscle of the heart, of the myocardium, it is precisely the left ventricle’ and he confirmed that my patient had suffered a lot. Then I asked him: ‘Doctor, why has my patient suffered a lot?’ He answered me: ‘Because your patient has some thrombi, at certain moments he could not breathe, oxygen did not reach him, he labored and suffered much because every aspiration was painful. Probably they gave him a blow at the level of the chest. Moreover the heart showed dynamic activity (alive) at the moment when you brought me the sample.’ ‘Why, I ask him?’ ‘Because we found some intact white blood cells and white blood cells are transported only by the blood and thus if white blood cells are here it is because at the moment in which you brought me the sample it was pulsating.’ The professor then asked to whom this sample belonged and when we told him that it came from a consecrated Host he exclaimed: ‘I do not believe it.’ He was greatly moved. The same professor had shown to us in a book the case of one of his patients who showed the same lesions, similar to those of the sample that we had brought to him. The myocardium is the muscle that gives life to the whole heart and to our body. Rightly a theologian made me note that the fact that it was really the myocardium, was not casual but it concealed a symbolism. The Lord in this miracle wanted to show us his myocardium, which is the muscle that gives life to the whole heart, just as the Eucharist does with the Church. And why the left ventricle? Because from it comes the purified blood and Jesus is the one Who purifies his Church from her sins. ‘Doctor - Professor Zugibe said to me again, at the moment in which you brought me this sample, this heart was alive!’ His report was sent out on March 26, 2005, 5 years and a half after the start of the studies and the conclusions were: ‘They are tissues of the heart, undergoing degenerative changes of the myocardium and these changes are due to the fact that the cells are inflamed and it is the left ventricle of the heart.’” On March 17, 2006 I brought the results to Cardinal Jorge Maria Bergoglio.",

      "summary": "The little village of St. Georgenberg-Fiecht in the Inn Valley is very well known - especially because of a Eucharistic miracle that took place there in 1310. During the Mass, the priest was seized with temptations regarding the Real Presence of Jesus in the consecrated Elements. Right after the consecration, the wine changed into Blood and began to boil and overflow the chalice. In 1480, after 170 years, the Sacred Blood was \"still fresh as though coming out of a wound,\" wrote the chronicler of those days. The Precious Blood is preserved intact to this day and is contained in the reliquary in the Monastery of St. Georgenberg.",
      "text": "Near the side altar of the monastery church there is a documentary tablet that says: “In the year of grace 1310, under Abbot Rupert, a priest was celebrating Holy Mass in this church dedicated to the holy martyr George and the holy apostle, James. After consecrating the wine, he was seized with a doubt as to whether the Blood of Christ was really present under the species of wine. Suddenly the wine changed into red blood that began to boil in the chalice and overflow it. The abbot and his monks, who happened to be in the choir, and the numerous pilgrims who were present at the celebration, approached the altar and realized what had happened. The priest, terrified, was unable to drink all the Holy Blood, and so the abbot placed the remainder in a vessel in the tabernacle of the main altar near the cloth with which the chalice was wiped. As soon as news of this miraculous event began to spread, more and more pilgrims began to arrive to adore the Sacred Blood. So great was the number of the devotees of the Holy Blood that in 1472 Bishop Georg von Brixen sent the abbot of Wilten, Joahannes Lösch, and the pastors, Sigmund Thaur and Kaspar of Absam, to better study the phenomenon. As a result of this investigation, the adoration of the Blessed Blood was encouraged and the miracle was declared authentic. “Among the devotees were important Church personalities, like John, Bishop of Trieste; George, Bishop of Brixen; Rupert, Archbishop of Cologne and Duke of Bavaria; and Frederick, Bishop of Chiemsee.” A second documentary tablet recounts how the relic of the Holy Blood helped preserve the Catholic faith during the Protestant schism: “When in 1593, the teachings of Luther were spreading everywhere in Tyrol, the monks of St. Georgenberg were asked to preach the faith everywhere. Abbot Michael Geisser was preaching with great success before a large crowd in the parish church of Schwaz and did not hesitate to recall the holy miracle of the Blood as proof of the existence of the Real Presence of Jesus Christ in the Blessed Sacrament of the Altar. He was disputing in such a convincing way that the adversaries were obliged to leave the scene. This total victory against the false teaching was regarded by the believers as a special grace the Lord was granting His faithful, the adorers of the Precious Blood.”",

Oswald grasped the altar so as not to fall, and the priest immediately took back the Host from the man’s mouth. The trembling stopped, and live Blood began to flow from the Host. There were many witnesses who saw the miracle, and very soon the news spread throughout the whole nation. The Emperor Maximilian I himself was very devoted to the miracle.

      "text": "In the parish church of Weiten, a thief broke into the sacristy and got hold of a consecrated Host that he slipped into one of his gloves. According to reports from the village of Weiten, the theft occurred in 1411. The thief then mounted his horse intending to make for the nearby village of Spitz. Instead of taking the main road, he chose a side road that passes through the valley of Mühldorf and is known as “Am Schuß.” When he arrived at the spot (that today is marked by a chapel in honor of the miracle) his horse halted and would not move, no matter how much the man beat him. Some laborers working in the surrounding fields came to help. But there was no way to make the horse move; it stood still as a statue. Then without warning, the animal leaped to a gallop, and the Sacred Host hidden in the rider's glove dropped to the ground without anyone noticing. A few days later, a Mrs. Scheck from Mannersdorf passed by the spot and saw the Host encircled in a strong light. In great wonder, she picked up the Holy Eucharist and noticed that the consecrated Host was broken in two Parts but remained joined together by threads of Bleeding Flesh. Greatly moved and at her own expense, in thanksgiving, she built a small chapel on the spot. As news of the miracle spread, many pilgrims came to the place. Later, it was necessary to build a bigger church to honor the precious reliquary in order to contain the great crowds that came every year on pilgrimage.",

      "text": "Starting on the Tuesday before Pentecost of the year 1405, the Lord appeared covered with His wounds to John of Huldenberg, master of the place. Only at the third apparition did our Lord speak ordering John “Go into the Chapel of Isaac, you will find Me there.” At the same time, the parish priest, Peter Ost, heard a voice instructing him to offer the Mass of the Holy Cross in the Chapel of Isaac. The following day the pastor summoned all the faithful to assist at Mass at the Chapel of Isaac. John of Huldenberg was among those present. The priest began the Mass, and when he unfolded the corporal he saw there a Particle of the large Host that had been consecrated the preceding Tuesday. He sought to receive the Host but the Eucharist clung to the corporal and began to Bleed. The priest turned white and John, who had observed everything, comforted him by saying: “Do not fear, this marvel comes from God”, and related his visions. For four days, that is until Tuesday after Pentecost, the Blood continued to flow, reaching the length of a finger in three breadths. Then, having stained the entire corporal, the Blood co-agulated little by little and dried up. The miracle was seen and attested to by many. The Bishop of Cambrai, Peter d' Ailly, was informed of what happened and he decided to investigate personally and had the corporal in his care for some two years. Every attempt to remove the stains of Blood on the corporal were useless. The Bishop opened an investigation where testimonies were gathered regarding the prodigies wrought by the reliquary of the precious Blood. On June 16, 1410, the Bishop granted an indulgence of 40 days to those who visited the Chapel at Bois-Seigneur-Isaac. On May 3, 1413, he allowed the corporal to be venerated as a relic and established a solemn procession in honor of the miracle, along with public exposition of the Blessed Sacrament.

Although in the Bible there is no explicit mention that the Blood of Christ was ever preserved, in one of the Apocryphal Gospels it is narrated that Joseph of Arimathea preserved some drops of the Blood of Christ. According to an ancient tradition, Count Diederik van den Elzas brought the bottle containing the Blood of Christ from Jerusalem to Bruges during the second crusade. Recent investigations however have pointed out that the relic arrived in Bruges at a later date, probably around 1250 coming from Constantinople. The veneration of the relic is at the origin of the internationally famous procession that is held every year through the streets of the city on the day of the Feast of the Ascension.

The Kings of Belgium, Leopold I and Leopold II, presented the first windows on the lower level. The others were gifts from various noble families of the country. The first ten windows represent the story as it came to Brussels in the middle of the 15th century. The ancient document reads : “In 1369 a rich merchant from Enghien who hated the Catholic religion, had some consecrated Hosts stolen. He worked with a young man from Louvain (on windows 1-3). The merchant was assassinated mysteriously a few days later. His widow, surmising it was a punishment from Heaven, got rid of the Hosts by giving them to friends of her husband. These friends were filled with hatred of things Catholic. “On Good Friday 1370, the friends met and began to slash the Hosts with knives, and the Hosts began to bleed! The desecrators were badly frightened and entrusted the Hosts to an important Catholic merchant. “This merchant revealed the whole story to the curate of the Church of Notre Dame. The curate took possession of the Hosts and the desecrators were condemned to death by the Duke of Brabant. The Hosts were taken in procession to the cathedral of St. Gudula”.

This professional man was stealing sacred objects from churches and selling them all over Europe. The day after his arrival at Herentals, he went to the nearby village of Poederle. He entered the parish church and without being noticed, stole the chalice and the ciborium containing five consecrated Hosts. As he was returning to Herentals in the place known as “De Hegge” (“the fence”), he felt as if pulled by a mysterious force that was keeping him from continuing his journey. So he tried to get rid of the Hosts by throwing them into the river, but his every attempt to do so was useless. Jan was on the verge of despair when he saw a field not very far away with a big rabbit burrow where he straightaway hid the Hosts. The task took place without any trouble, and the man was able to peacefully return to Herentals. In the meantime, the city judge, Gilbert De Pape, began an investigation to discover the author of the theft in the church of Poederle. Among the suspects was our Jan. The police searched his luggage and found the chalice and the ciborium. Jan then confessed everything except the fact that he had thrown the Hosts away. He was to be immediately hanged, and Jan had already climbed the scaffold when, encouraged by the priest to cleanse his soul before dying, completely confessed his guilt. The judge then suspended the execution and ordered Jan to indicate the exact place where he had left the Hosts. A large crowd followed them. As soon as they arrived at the field, they saw the Hosts all radiant, arranged in the form of a cross. Strangely, the Hosts remained intact, notwithstanding the weather, and they were at once brought back in procession, some to Herentals and some to Poederle, where they remained until the 16th century. On January 2, 1441, the miracle was declared authentic by the magistrate of Herentals. At the place where the Hosts were found a small chapel was built which was visited by numerous prelates, such as Jean Malderus, Bishop of Anvers in 1620, and Pope Benedict XIV in 1749.

One of the family members, curious about the handbag, opened it without being noticed. From it he pulled out the pyx, opened the cover and put his hand into it. As soon as he realized that inside there was a Host, he put everything back in order. In the meantime, the priest came out from the room of the sick person to take out the Host with which to give him Communion. He took the handbag with the pyx inside, and when he opened it he saw that the Host he himself had consecrated during Mass was stained with Blood and was in some way stuck to the linen that covered the bottom of the container. Troubled and panic-stricken with the excuse that he had forgotten something, he rushed out of the house and went to the pastor of nearby Lumen to tell him what had happened. The latter advised him to bring the Particle to the Abbey of Herkenrode. It was August 1, 1317. The priest left, taking the pyx with him. Along the road, extraordinary things happened. As soon as he arrived at the Benedictine monastery, he showed everybody the Host stained with Blood. Then, the face of Christ crowned with thorns appeared on the Host. This was attested to by numerous witnesses. In the Cathedral of Hasselt there is a painting in which there is depicted a flock kneeling as the priest, carrying the sacred relic, passes by. In this place, called Sacramentsberg, a chapel was built as a perpetual memorial. From that time on, “the Blessed Sacrament of the Miracle,” which had been placed in a reliquary and exposed to public veneration, more than once protected the monastery of Herkenrode from fire.

In a monograph written in 1905 by historian Joseph Wils, professor of the Catholic University of Louvain, entitled Le Sacrement du Miracle de Louvain, are cited almost all the contemporary documents and testimonies. In Middleburg lived a noble woman known by everybody for her great faith and devotion. The woman was also very attentive to the spiritual formation of her family and household staff. During the Lent of 1374, as she did every year in her house, she began to do penance in preparation for the coming of Easter. A few days before, a new manservant by the name of Jan was hired, who had not gone to confession for many years, in spite of the dissolute life he was living. The woman invited all the household staff to go to Mass. Jan did not dare oppose this invitation so as not to disappoint her. He attended the whole Eucharistic celebration, and when it was time to receive Holy Communion, the man approached the altar with much superficiality. As soon as he received the Host on his tongue, the Sacrament changed into bleeding Flesh. At once Jan took the Particle from his mouth; Blood dripped from the Sacred Flesh onto the cloth covering the altar rail. The priest realized at once what was happening, and with great emotion, carefully placed the miraculous Particle in a vessel inside the tabernacle. Jan repented and confessed his sin before everyone. From that day on, he led an exemplary life and nourished a great devotion to the Most Blessed Sacrament to the end of his life. All the church and civil authorities of the city were informed of the miraculous event and after diligent investigation the Archbishop authorized the cult of this miraculous event. ",

The sea was rising and had already engulfed part of the beach. It had plunged inland a kilometer and a half and a mountainous wall of water was building up and threatening to drown everyone and everything in one gigantic wave. Fr. Gerardo consumed the small Hosts in the ciborium and set the large Host aside. He called out to his people: “Let us go, my people. Let us go toward the beach, and may God have pity on us.” Comforted by the presence of the Eucharistic Christ they began their march, weeping and crying out to God. Scarcely had Fr. Larrondo reached the beach with the monstrance in hand when he advanced courageously to the water’s edge and as the wave came rushing in he calmly raised the Sacred Host and traced the sign of the Cross. It was a moment of tremendous solemnity. The wave hesitated , paused and backed off. Fr. Larrondo and Fr. Julian alongside him saw what was transpiring, and the people, overjoyed, cried out “Miracle, miracle!”. In truth, a force beyond that of nature prevailed. The mighty wall of water that threatened to wipe the village of Tumaco off the face of the earth was halted and began to recede, and the sea resumed its normal level. The inhabitants of Tumaco were overcome with joy at having been saved from death by the favor of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament. Prayers of fervent thanks poured out. The miracle of Tumaco became known across the world, and Fr. Larrondo received letters from Europe asking for his prayers.",

During the consecration of the wine, the priest doubted the truth of transubstantiation, and the wine in the chalice turned into Blood. Not knowing what to do, the priest embedded this relic in the wall behind the main altar. The workman who did the job was sworn to silence. The priest also kept it secret and revealed it only at the time of his death. After the priest’s revelation, news quickly spread and people started coming on pilgrimage to Ludbreg. The Holy See later had the relic of the miracle brought to Rome, where it remained for several years. The people of Ludbreg and the surrounding area, however, continued to make pilgrimages to the castle chapel. In the early 1500s, during the pontificate of Pope Julius II, a commission was convened in Ludbreg to investigate the facts connected with the Eucharistic miracle. Many people testified that they had received marvelous cures while praying in the relic’s presence. On April 14, 1513, Pope Leo X published a Bull permitting veneration of the holy relic which he himself had carried in procession several times through the streets of Rome. The relic was later returned to Croatia. In the 18th century, northern Croatia was ravaged by the plague. The people turned to God to call upon His help, and the Croatian Parliament did the same. During the session held on December 15, 1739 in the city of Varazdin, they vowed to build a chapel at Ludbreg in honor of the miracle if the plague ended. The plague was averted, but the promised vow was only fulfilled in 1994, when democracy was restored in Croatia. In 2005 in the votive chapel, the artist Marijan Jakubin painted a large fresco of the Last Supper in which Croatian saints and blesseds were drawn in place of the Apostles. St. John was replaced with Blessed Ivan Merz, who was included among the 18 most important Eucharistic saints in the Church’s history during the Synod of Bishops held in Rome in 2005.

One day she came upon a ship about to set sail with different groups of passengers. She inquired who they might be and where they were going. She was told they were pilgrims sailing toward Jerusalem for the feast of the Exaltation of the Cross. She decided to join them. When on the feast day she tried to enter the church, she was seized by a mysterious force. Fearfully she raised her eyes to an image of the Holy Virgin and was overcome with a deep sorrow for the sinful life she had led until that day. Only then was she able to make her way into the church and worship the True Cross. She did not remain in Jerusalem. “If you go across the Jordan you will find peace” was the message of the Madonna. The following day after her confession and Communion she made her way across the Jordan to the desert of Arabia. There she lived for 47 years in solitude encountering neither men nor beasts. Her skin shriveled, her hair was long and white, but the promise of the Virgin proved true, she found her peace of soul. One day she met up with the Monk Zosimus and asked him to bring her Communion each year. One year Zosimus arrived with the Eucharist, but Mary did not show. In great sorrow Zosimus prayed: “Lord, my God, King and Creator of all, do not deprive me of my desire, but grant that I may see this holy woman.” Then he thought, “Now what will I do if she appears, there is no boat around to get me across? I will not achieve my wish.” While he gave into these thoughts, Mary appeared on the opposite shore and Zosimus was consoled. Then he saw her make the sign of the Cross over the water and walk out on it as though it were dry land. When 12 months had passed Zosimus returned but was unable to find the mummified remains of the saintly penitent. A lion had dug her grave and buried the body.",

In his ignorance he would say: ‘The Bread we receive is not really the Body of Christ, but is a symbol of that Body.’ Two of the more experienced monks heard his statement and, aware that he was a good and pious monk, decided to speak to him since they attributed his words to his ignorance and not to malice. So they informed him: ‘What you are saying contradicts our Faith.’ The accused replied: ‘Unless you can show me evidence, I will not change my mind.’ The older monks told him: ‘We will pray to God about this mystery and we believe God will show us the truth.’ “A week later, on Sunday, all went to the church. At the consecration, in place of the Host, a Young Boy was seen. When the priest raised the Eucharistic Bread an angel appeared with a sword and pierced the Boy and when the priest broke the Host, Blood ran into the chalice. At the Communion, the angel took Bloodied Particles from the Host and brought them to the monks to receive. At this the doubter cried out ‘Lord, I believe that the Bread is Your Body, and that Your Blood is in the chalice.’ Immediately the Bloodied Flesh he had in his hand became the Eucharistic Bread and he communicated reverently.”",

      "text": "The Eucharistic miracle of Avignon occured in the Church of the Holy Cross, home of the Gray Penitents of the Franciscan Order, whose founding goes back to the times of pious King Louis VIII. At the time of this miracle, Avignon was considered the center of Christendom, and the city’s “Palais des Papes” was home to a series of seven popes. After several days of heavy rain, the Sorgue and Rhône Rivers rose steadily and reached a dangerous height. Finally, on November 30, 1433, Avignon, was flooded. The friars were certain that their little church, which stood along the Sorgue, had been destroyed by the raging waters. Fearing that the Blessed Sacrament, which was exposed for Perpetual Adoration, had been swept away, the head of the Order and another friar rowed to the church. Getting there was difficult, but when they finally arrived they found a miracle. Although water around the church was four feet high, a pathway from the entrance of the church to the altar was perfectly dry. The Sacred Host was unscathed. The pathway from the entrance to the altar called to mind the parting of the Red Sea in the time of Moses, for all along the sides of the church, water steadily rose, but the pathway remained completely dry. Amazed by what they were seeing, the friars had others from their Order come to the church to verify the miracle. The news spread rapidly, and many people, including those in authority, came to the Church, singing songs of praise and of thanks to the Lord. Several hundred people witnessed this miracle. Later on, the Gray Penitents determined that the anniversary of the miracle would be celebrated in the church every year on the feast day of St. Andrew the Apostle. Even today, every November 30th, the brothers reunite at the Chapelle des Pénitents Gris to celebrate the memory of the miracle. Before the blessing of the Holy Sacrament, the brothers perform a sacred chant taken from the Canticle of Moses, which was composed after the parting of the Red Sea: “I will sing to the LORD, for he is gloriously triumphant… At a breath of your anger the waters piled up, the flowing waters stood like a mound, the flood waters congealed in the midst of the sea… In your mercy you led the people you redeemed; in your strength you guided them to your holy dwelling.” (Exodus 15, 1-18).

That cloth is preserved today in the village of Blanot.",

The bishop of this town, Pierre Bertrand, was involved in certain canonical discussions with an official of his curia, Jean Jarossier, which resulted in documentation that gives us many details about this Eucharistic miracle. The miracle occurred on Easter Sunday, March 31, 1331, at the first Mass of the day, which was offered by Hugues de la Baume, the vicar of Blanot. One of the last people to receive Communion was a woman named Jacquette, the widow of Regnaut d’Effour. The priest placed the Host on her tongue, turned, and started walking toward the altar. He did not notice that a Particle from the Host fell and landed upon a cloth that covered the woman’s hands. Thomas Caillot, who was assisting at the Mass went to the altar and said: “Father, you must return to the rail because the Body of Our Lord fell from the mouth of this lady onto the cloth.” The priest immediately went to the woman, still kneeling at the railing, but instead of finding the Host on the cloth, he saw a small spot of Blood. When Mass was over, the priest took the cloth into the sacristy and placed the stained area in a basin filled with clear water. After washing the spot and scrubbing it numerous times, he found that it had become darker and larger (reaching about the size and shape of a Host). Moreover, the water in the basin turned Bloody. The priest took a knife and, after washing the cloth, cut from it the piece bearing the Bloody imprint of the Host. He held up the Sacred Host and said: “Good people: here is the Precious Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ. I sought in every way to wash and to wring the stain from the cloth, and in no way was I able to do so.” This square of cloth was reverently placed in the tabernacle. Every year, on the feast of Corpus Christi, the relic is solemnly exposed in the church of Blanot. An additional note: The Hosts that remained in the ciborium after the distribution of Holy Communion on that Easter Sunday were also returned to the tabernacle, never to be distributed. Hundreds of years later they were found to have been perfectly preserved. ",

The Dean opened the small case in which he had reposed the Host of the miracle, but initially I didn't see anything special. “I was conscious though, that nothing could prevent me from seeing, as was true of the others, the Sacred Body. I didn’t even have time to ask myself this type of question, when I scarcely looked at the Host and saw the face of Christ crowned with thorns with two drops of Blood that descended on His forehead. Immediately I knelt, and crying, I began to thank God”. It is certain that already by the year 1356, that is, one century after the apparition, every year on Wednesday of Holy Week, a feast in memory of the miracle of the Blessed Sacrament was celebrated, and the document which records it indicates that this event was in existence already for a long time. The precious relic of the miracle was conserved and honored until the Revolution. Then all signs of this marvel were lost for many years. In October 1854, the Pastor of the Church of St. Peter by chance discovered underneath the Christ in the Altar of the Dead, a small wooden box containing a small Host, still white, but with damaged edges.

They held only the highest esteem for the devotion to the Lady of Notre-Dame la Blanche, known in all the area for its many miracles. Through her intercession many miracles had in fact been verified, among which was even the returning to life of two infants who were not yet baptized. In 1608, on the Vigil of the Feast of Pentecost, the monks decided to prepare an altar for the exposition and adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. The lunette of the monstrance was very large, and because of this, they decided to put in two Hosts. When Vespers had finished the monks left the monstrance exposed on the provisional altar. On the next morning, the sacristan opened the church and found it full of smoke, with the provisional altar completely reduced to ashes. He started to yell, and immediately the religious and other people hastened and proceeded to remove the ashes with the hope of finding some part of the monstrance. When the smoke began to clear, they were astonished on seeing that the monstrance was suspended in the air. The multitude increased and crowded to see the Eucharistic marvel, in which the Hosts had remained unharmed regardless of the fire. The religious were astonished and unable to make a decision. They asked the counsel of the Capuchin friars of Vesoul. The friars immediately prepared a new altar over the burned one and celebrated Holy Mass. During the elevation of the Host, the monstrance slowly descended upon the new altar. When the canonical process finished, on July 10, the Archbishop of Besançon declared that the miracle was authentic, and on September 13, the Archbishop of Rodi, who was the nuncio in Brussels, made it known to Pope Paul V who granted a Bull of Indulgence. The miracle rekindled the faith of many. In 1862, the Congregation of Rites authorized the celebration of the miracle. In 1908 the third centenary of the miracle was solemnly commemorated with a National Eucharistic Congress. Even today it is possible to see and venerate the relic containing one of the two Hosts which remained unharmed. The other Host, unfortunately, after it was donated to the Church of Dole, was destroyed by the revolutionaries in 1794.",

Bertrand had been paralyzed and mute since the age of seven due to a terrible fall. When the time for Holy Communion arrived, he indicated to his mother that he also wanted to receive Jesus in the Eucharist. Initially the priest did not want to give the young man Communion, because the boy was not able to go to Confession given his muteness. The young man, however, continued to beseech the priest for Communion and, in the end, the priest did permit him to receive the Blessed Sacrament. From the first moment that Bertrand received the Host, he began to feel shaken by a mysterious force. He was able to move and to speak. He was cured. According to the hand-written document, immediately after the miraculous event Bertrand’s first words were, “Adjutorium nostrum in nomine Domini!” (“Our help is in the name of the Lord!”) The most authoritative document that visually describes this miracle is the painted manuscript preserved to this day in the Cathedral of La Rochelle.",

The Archbishop of Bruges, André Frémiot, founded the Confraternity of the Most Precious Blood in the year 1621. Two years later, Pope Gregory XV granted new indulgences to the faithful devoted to the Sacred Blood.

      "text": "On June 2 1668, Saturday of the Octave of Corpus Christi, in the small Church of Les Ulmes, the Blessed Sacrament was exposed for public adoration. The Pastor of the Church, Nicolas Nezan, began to incense the monstrance. While the hymn Pange Lingua was being sung, “and having reached the stanza ‘Verbum caro Panem verum’, the shape of a man appeared in the monstrance in place of the Host. He appeared to have light brown hair that fell over his back, a luminous face, the hands crossed one over the other, and the body covered by a white tunic. This apparition lasted for more than a quarter of an hour, whether on the tabernacle where the Blessed Sacrament was exposed, or on the altar where the priest had moved the Blessed Sacrament to allow a closer look to all those present.” On June 13, the pastor immediately sent a message of what had occurred to his Bishop, Henry Arnauld, who quickly ordered an inquiry. On June 25 the pastoral letter was published containing the “faithful description” of the marvel. Among the several works which followed and which sought the objective description contained in the letter, we remember that of the Dominican Father Gonet, who describes the event in Volume VIII of his work Clypeus Theologiae, published for the first time in 1669 by the French editor Bertier. The Bishop ordered this fact to be diffused widely, therefore three writings were immediately commissioned: one of Edelynck which is still in Paris, of optimal quality; one of Jean Bidault di Saumur and lastly, one by the editor Ernoudi Parigi. At the end of the 18th century in the parish of Les Ulmes, every year the anniversary of the apparition was solemnly celebrated. In 1901 the International Eucharistic Congress of Angers was celebrated in this parish and in July 1933, during the National Eucharistic Congress, a complete session of study was dedicated to the miracle of 1668. Even today in the church, the recess can be seen that for 130 years contained the miraculous Host.

While he was walking, a rock on the side of the road captured his attention, because it did not have any snow on it. When he lifted the rock, he was amazed to find the Hosts completely intact. He immediately told the pastor, Father Prothais, who, accompanied by many of the faithful, carried the Hosts into the parish church. They placed a cross on the location where the Hosts were found, and in order to accommodate the large number of devoted faithful who would come to visit, eventually built the Chapel of the Sacred Hosts. The Lord worked many miracles at this chapel. The historian, Pierre Louvet describes some of these miracles in his Histoire de la Ville de Beauvais. There was the extraordinary story of the priest, Father Jacques Sauvage, who was completely healed after being paralyzed and having lost his ability to speak. Mr. d’Autreche, blind from birth, regained his sight. Despite all of these graces given by God, the Bishop-Count of Beauvais, Odet de Coligny, converted to Calvinism and married Elizabeth of Hauteville.

      "text": "There are numerous documents that testify to the events of this miracle. The Italian historian Giovanni Villani in Book VII, Chapter 136, of his celebrated History of Florence reports all the principal facts of the miracle. A deep study of the sources was done by Mrs. Moreau-Rendu in a work entitled. A Paris, Rue des Jardins published in 1954 with a preface by Bishop Touzé who was the Auxiliary Bishop of Paris. The author, after a detailed list of the documents, placed them under rigorous examination and declared with confidence the authenticity of the facts. The best known version of the story is found in the History of the Church of Paris written by the French archbishop, Archbishop Rupp, who tells of the Eucharistic miracle of Paris in the pages dedicated to the episcopate of Simon Matifas of Busay who held the See of St. Denis from 1290 to 1304: “Easter Sunday, April 2, 1290, a man named Jonathas, who hated the Catholic Faith and did not believe in the Real Presence of Christ in the Holy Eucharist, was able to gain possession of a consecrated Host. “The man stabbed the Host with a knife and the Host began to bleed. The Blood filled the container in which he had placed the Host. Panic-stricken, the man decided to throw the Blessed Sacrament into the fire, but the Host miraculously arose from the fire. Desperate, he threw the Eucharist into boiling water and the Host arose from the water, hovering in mid-air, and then taking the form of a crucifix. Finally, he deposited the Holy Eucharist in the bowl of a parishioner of SaintJean-en–Grève who brought the Blessed Sacrament to her parish priest. Over the centuries, the Sacred Relic remained in a small reliquary in the church of Saint-Jean. During the French Revolution the Precious Relic was lost without a trace.” Here are some other equally significant facts: The ecclesiastical authorities, the people and the king decided to transform the home of the one who desecrated the Sacred Host into a chapel in which the Holy Eucharist would be kept; the confiscation of the house of Jonathas, called “The House of Miracles” by King Phillip the Fair which was registered in a bill of sale from 1291; the transformation of the house into an oratory after the Bull that was obtained from Pope Boniface VIII; the name of the “Rue du Dieu bouilli” (The Street of God-boiled) given by the people of Paris to the “Rue des Jardins”; the Eucharistic celebration in the Chapel des Billettes of the Department of the Reparation on the second Sundays of Advent and Lent.",

The Miraculous Host was consumed the day after, but there are many documents which testify to this miracle still in existence today. Among these documents are the windows of the church of Pressac which depict the different phases of the miracle.",
      "text": "The miracle occurred on Holy Thursday, 1643. After having celebrated Mass and everyone had received Communion, the people of the town returned to their jobs and the priest placed the chalice back into the repository. This was near the altar dedicated to the Blessed Virgin which had four pillars of wood supporting a marble slab on top of which was a corporal. Behind the altar there was a depiction of a Eucharistic scene. A veil covered the chalice and two large candles were lit at the foot of the repository. It was mid-day and the sacristan closed the door of the church. Two hours later, those nearby noticed thick, black smoke coming from the windows of the church. Since the windows had inadvertently been left open, this probably fanned the flames of the candles and accelerated the fire. The people called the sacristan to open the doors and they all entered to assess the damage. The repository and the painting were destroyed. What was left were the marble slab, the corporal and the foot of the chalice. The report would later say that almost the entire cup was transformed into “drops of tin.” Above what was left of the chalice there formed a bubble of tin under which the Host was found completely intact having withstood the flames and the fusion of the metal. The vicar, Simon Sauvage, came to the place of the miracle and carried the damaged chalice to the main altar for all to see. The Host, light red around the edges, was consumed the next morning during the Divine Office of Good Friday. We should remember that the Liturgy back then held that only one of the consecrated Hosts should be reserved in the ciborium and placed in a chalice covered by a simple veil. The Abbot of Availles-Limouzine, François du Theil, recorded all of the testimony and gave it to the Bishop of Poitiers, Henri Louis Chastagnier de la Roche-Posay who authorized the cult of the miracle with a solemn act which states: “The Sacred Mysteries are incomprehensible, if the splendor of grace does not illumine the spirit in order to elevate it to the highest understanding of the wondrous effects of the power of God and to obligate all men to adore Him, who is owed their adoration. The ineffable goodness of God is manifested at times in extraordinary ways, working miracles in the Church in order to confirm the Catholic Faith and to confound the errors of the unfaithful spirits.”",

After communion, without being noticed, she put the Host in a handkerchief, took the Blessed Sacrament home and placed the Eucharistic Species in a container of wax inside a cupboard. In those days it was very difficult to find tabernacles in the church so as to be able to practice Eucharistic worship. Only in 1264, with the introduction of the Feast of Corpus Domini (Corpus Christi) did such devotion become commonplace. Five years passed and on the 11th of May 1199, the woman, tormented by remorse, confessed to the superior of the convent of the Heilig Kreuz, Father Berthold, who had her bring the Host back. The priest opened up the wax covering that enclosed the Host and saw that the Holy Eucharist had been transformed into bleeding Flesh. The Host appeared “divided into two Parts connected together by the thin threads of the bleeding Flesh.” Father Berthold went immediately to the bishop of the city of Udalskalk who ordered that the Miraculous Host be “transferred, accompanied by the clergy and by the people into the cathedral and exhibited in an ostensorium of crystal for public worship.” The miracle continued: the Host began to grow and to swell up and this phenomenon lasted before the eyes of all from Easter Sunday until the Feast of St. John the Baptist. Following this, Bishop Udalskalk had the Host brought back near the convent of the Heilig Kreuz and proclamed that “in memory of such a memorable and extraordinary event,” there should be a special commemoration each year in honor of the holy relic. In 1200, Count Rechber donated to the Augustinian Fathers a rectangular chest of silver with an opening in the front for the placement of the Host of the miracle. Besides the Eucharistic miracle, other extraordinary incidences took place, such as the apparition of the Host with Baby Jesus dressed in white with radiant face and His forehead encircled with a crown of gold, or in another case the bleeding of the crucifix of the church, or the apparition of Jesus blessing the assembly of worshippers.

The owner was a man who was deeply devoted to the Most Holy Sacrament. This man lived an hour and a half away from the parish church of Tholling and he was not always able to attend Mass. Because of his zeal, he decided to solve the problem of not always being able to attend church by secretly stealing a Sacred Host and taking the Blessed Sacrament home with him. The farmer took the stick that he always brought with him and made an opening on the top end of it, into which he placed the Sacred Host. Every day, when the livestock were resting, he stuck his stick into the ground and knelt before the Most Holy Sacrament for many hours. For several months, the man continued in this manner until one day, without thinking, he impulsively threw the stick with the Blessed Sacrament at a herd that had strayed too far. The Host fell on the ground and the farmer, deeply saddened, bent down to pick up the Blessed Sacrament. Every attempt to lift the Host up proved to be futile and when he did not know what else to do he sent for the parish priest of Tholling. But the priest was also not able to pick up the Blessed Sacrament and finally they approached the Bishop Hartwich of Regensburg, who immediately went to the place of the miracle with all his clergymen. Only when he promised to build a chapel in that place did he succeed in picking up the Host from the ground. In 1125, the building of the chapel was completed and the precious relic was kept in this place until 1330 when a fire destroyed everything.

He searched everywhere, to no avail. Frightened by what had happened, he immediately ran to inform the pastor, who immediately went to the spot where the Host had disappeared.

      "text": "On Holy Thursday, March 25, 1255, a priest of Ratisbonne was taking Holy Viaticum to a dying patient when, upon entering the city, he suddenly found himself before a stream overflowing because of an unexpected storm. To allow the people to pass from one bank to the other, they had placed a simple plank of wood. While crossing it, the priest slipped and dropped the ciborium containing the consecrated Hosts. As an act of reparation, the priest, the faithful, and the civil authority decided the same day to construct a chapel on the site of the accident. On September 8, 1255, Bishop Albert consecrated the chapel in honor of the Savior, to which the Blessed Sacrament was carried in solemn procession. From that moment the sanctuary began to be frequented by numerous faithful. Two years later an extraordinary event confirmed the holiness of the place. A priest was celebrating the Holy Mass in the little chapel, when he was struck by doubt regarding the Real Presence of Jesus in the Eucharist. He delayed, therefore, in elevating the chalice and suddenly heard a light noise come from the altar. From the wooden crucifix above the altar, the Lord slowly extended his arms to the priest, took the chalice from his hands and exhibited the Blessed Sacrament for the adoration of the faithful. The priest, repentant, fell to his knees and begged forgiveness for having doubted. The Lord returned the chalice to him as a sign of pardon.

Immediately upon spilling, the Precious Blood formed on the corporal an image of the Crucified Christ, surrounded by eleven identical images of the Head of Christ crowned with thorns. The priest did not have the courage to reveal the miracle and for many years he kept the corporal hidden under the altar. It was only near the point of his death that he confessed, then told the story of the event and revealed the corporal. From the beginning, the reliquary of the corporal has had much veneration, and many conversions and miraculous recoveries are attributed to this. Pope Eugene IV confirmed the miracle in 1445 and granted some indulgences. The miracle was famous across Europe and for centuries was depicted by many artists. The actual basilica was constructed between 1698 and 1728 by Franz Lothar von Schonborn, the Archbishop of Mainz. In 1962, Pope John XXIII elevated the church to a minor basilica. Augustinian monks have protected the basilica since 1938.",

When Guelfo IV of Bavaria sought Judith as his spouse, she gave him the Precious Relic, which he himself later gave to the Benedictines at Weingarten, directed at that time by Abbot Wilichon. The solemn ceremony took place March 4, 1094. For this reason the Benedictine Abbey received numerous indulgences from various popes, such that this church became a religious center of extraordinary importance.

For example, Count Dietrich von Wenckstern, who nurtured many doubts regarding the Bleeding of the Hosts, lost his vision, which was restored only when he repented of having doubted the authenticity of the miracle. This news spread rapidly, and already in 1384 the Bishop of Havelburg had confirmed the miracle of the “Bleeding” Hosts of Wilsnack. Pope Urban VI contributed an endowment for reconstruction of the church, to which was added offerings by the Archbishop of Magdeburg, and of the Bishops of Brandenburg, Havelberg, and Levus. Until the 1500s, Wilsnack became one of the most important places of pilgrimage in Europe. Thanks to numerous offerings left by pilgrims who came to venerate the miraculous Hosts, it was possible to finance the construction of the enormous Church of St. Nikolai, dedicated to the miracle. Even today the church offers one of the most important examples of the Gothic style in fired brick typical of northern Germany.

At 8:49am, I exposed the Most Holy Sacrament in the monstrance for public adoration. After a few moments I saw what appeared to be three dots in the Holy Eucharist. I then stopped praying and began to look at the monstrance, also inviting the faithful to admire the three dots. I then asked the faithful to remain in prayer and reposed the monstrance in the tabernacle. On April 30th, I celebrated the Holy Mass and on the following day I left for Trivandrum. On Saturday morning, the 5th of May 2001, I opened the church for the usual liturgical celebrations. I vested for Mass and went to open the tabernacle to see what had happened to the Eucharist in the monstrance. I immediately noted in the Host, a figure, to the likeness of a human face. I was deeply moved and asked the faithful to kneel and begin praying. I thought I alone could see the face so I asked the altar server what he noticed in the monstrance. He answered: ‘I see the figure of a man.’ I noticed that the rest of the faithful were looking intently at the monstrance. “We began Adoration and as the minutes went by, the image became more and more clear. I did not have the courage to say anything and I began to cry. During Adoration, we have the practice of reading a passage from Holy Scriptures. The reading of the day was the one from Chapter 20 in the Gospel of John, which narrates the story of when Jesus appeared to St. Thomas and asked him to look at the wounds. I was only able to say a few words in my homily, and, having to leave for the nearby parish of Kokkodu to celebrate Mass, I immediately summoned a photographer to take pictures of the Holy Eucharist with the human face on it. After two hours all the photos were developed; with the passing of the time the face in every photo became more and more clear.”",

The Most Holy Sacrament was exposed in the tabernacle. I began to celebrate the Mass. After the elevation, at the moment of the Our Father, my eyes were lifted toward the Host and I saw a bright halo around the rays of the monstrance. I continued to recite the prayers of the Mass with great agitation in my soul but which I tried to overcome. We came to the moment for Communion and again I looked toward the monstrance. This time I saw a human face, with lowered eyes and a crown of thorns on the forehead. What moved me the most was the dolorous expression painted on the face. The eyelashes were long and thick. I tried not to let on to the presence of the turmoil agitating inside of me. After Mass, I went to the sacristy and summoned the older children from the choir to go to the altar and closely observe the monstrance. “The children raced back and told me: ‘Father, we see the head of a man in the Host. It is the good Lord revealing Himself!’ I understood then that the vision was authentic. A young man of 16, Adam de Villiers, who had studied in a college in France, also arrived. I said to him as well: ‘Go in the church and see if you notice something strange in the tabernacle’. The young student went to the sacristy and returned immediately, saying: ‘Father, it is the good Lord who appears in the Host. I see His divine face’. Since then, all my doubts disappeared. Slowly the entire town went to the church to see the miracle. Journalists and people from the capital of Saint Denis also arrived. The face on the Host suddenly became animated and the crown of thorns disappeared. I used every possible precaution, and fearing the effects from the rays of light, I had all the candles extinguished and the shutters closed. The phenomenon became even more clear. There was a young artist among the visitors who faithfully reproduced the face in the Host. Later, the vision changed again and a crucifix appeared which covered the entire Host from top to bottom. After the Eucharistic blessing and recital of the Tantum Ergo, the vision disappeared.”",

The text reads: “Gregory, Bishop and Servant of the Servants of God, to Venerable Brother Bishop of Alatri, greetings and Apostolic blessing. We have received your letter, dearest brother, in which you informed us of a certain young woman misguided by an evil woman, who, after having received from the priest the Most Holy Body of Christ, held the Sacred Host in her mouth until the right moment to conceal the Holy Eucharist in a cloth. After three days, she discovered the same Body which she had received in the form of bread transformed into flesh, as everyone has been able to verify with their own eyes. Because both women have humbly revealed this to you, you desire our opinion regarding the punishment that should be imposed upon them. First, we give thanks with all our strength to Him Who, though He always operates in marvelous ways, in this case repeats miracles and produces new wonders so that He calls to sinners, converts evildoers and confounds heretics while strengthening faith in the truth of the Catholic Church, sustaining hope and reigniting charity. Thus, dearest brother, by means of this apostolic letter, we dispose that you inflict a milder punishment on the young woman, whom we hold to have done this more from weakness than malice, especially because it can be believed that she has sufficiently repented in confessing her sin. To the instigator, who with her perversion pushed the young woman to commit sacrilege, apply those disciplinary measures that we believe opportune to leave to your judgment. She should also visit the nearest bishop so that she can humbly confess her crime, imploring pardon with devout submission.” The Pope interpreted this episode as a sign against the widespread heresies regarding the Real Presence of Jesus in the Eucharist and pardoned the two repentant women. A commemorative medal was coined on the 750th anniversary of the miracle; one side showed the cathedral façade and the reliquary, while the other a bust of Pope Gregory IX with the Papal Bull.",

      "text": "This Eucharistic miracle is cited in The History of Saint Clare, Virgin written by Tommaso da Celano, and describes how Saint Clare of Assisi succeeded, with the Blessed Sacrament, in turning away Saracen troops in the pay of Emperor Frederick II of Sweden. The history goes like this: “By imperial order, regiments of Saracen soldiers and bowmen were stationed there (the convent of San Damiano in Assisi, Italy), massed like bees, ready to devastate the encampments and seize the cities. Once, during an enemy attack against Assisi, city beloved of the Lord, and while the army was approaching the gates, the fierce Saracens invaded San Damiano, entered the confines of the monastery and even the very cloister of the virgins. The women swooned in terror, their voices trembling with fear as they cried to their Mother, Saint Clare. “Saint Clare, with a fearless heart, commanded them to lead her, sick as she was, to the enemy, preceded by a silver and ivory case in which the Body of the Saint of saints was kept with great devotion. And prostrating herself before the Lord, she spoke tearfully to her Christ: ‘Behold, my Lord, is it possible You want to deliver into the hands of pagans Your defenseless handmaids, whom I have taught out of love for You? I pray You, Lord, protect these Your handmaids whom I cannot now save by myself.’ Suddenly a voice like that of a child resounded in her ears from the tabernacle: ‘I will always protect you!’ ‘My Lord,’ she added, ‘if it is Your wish, protect also this city which is sustained by Your love.’ Christ replied, ‘It will have to undergo trials, but it will be defended by My protection.’ Then the virgin, raising a face bathed in tears, comforted the sisters: ‘I assure you, daughters, that you will suffer no evil; only have faith in Christ.’ Upon seeing the courage of the sisters, the Saracens took flight and fled back over the walls they had scaled, unnerved by the strength of she who prayed. And Clare immediately admonished those who heard the voice I spoke of above, telling them severely: ‘Take care not to tell anyone about that voice while I am still alive, dearest daughters.’”",

      "text": "On July 25, 1535, while celebrating Mass at the main altar of the Collegiate Church of San Secondo at about 7:00 o’clock in the morning, a holy priest by the name of Domenico Occelli prepared to break the Host and noticed that, along the entire break, the Host was becoming red with living Blood. Three drops fell into the chalice and a fourth one remained at the extreme end of the Host. At first, Fr. Domenico continued the celebration of the Mass. But when he broke off the portion of the Host that had to be placed in the chalice, Blood came out of the Host. He could not believe his eyes, and he turned to the people, asking them to come to the altar and observe the miracle. When the priest was about to consume the Host, the Blood disappeared at once and the Host returned to the natural purity of the Eucharist. These are the facts as described in the translation of the official report sent by Bishop Scipione Roero of Asti to the Holy See and reproduced in the Apostolic Brief of November 6, 1535. In this Apostolic Brief Pope Paul III granted a plenary indulgence to those “who visited the Saint’s church on the day commemorating the miracle and recited three Our Fathers and Three Hail Marys according the intention of the Holy Father.” According to another document, reproduced in an inscription on marble, on that occasion some heretical soldiers converted to the faith. In those days, Asti was under the dominion of Emperor Charles V, and many of his troops were living in the city. This account is found in the Vatican archives from which a copy was made in 1884 at the request of Canon Longo and is also found in the book of the Company of the Most Blessed Sacrament, founded in the Collegiate Church of San Secondo as far back as 1519.

The church of the institute was divided into two parts, the front where the extraneous could gather, and at the back behind the altar, reserved to the boarding students. In the front part of the altar, there was only the notary public Scipione Alessandro Ambrogio, chancellor of the Bishop and treasurer of the institute, and a nephew of the priest was a server at the Mass. And in the back part there were the boarding students. When the priest was at the point of elevating the consecrated Host, Dr. Ambrogio realized the Blessed Sacrament was divided into two Parts. As soon as the priest elevated the cup, the man, convinced that a broken consecrated Host was not valid, went toward the altar to advise the priest, and ran in the sacristy right away to get another consecrated Host. In the meantime the priest elevated the Host and really found the two Parts tainted by Blood. The bottom of the cup also had Blood, and little stains were on the same corporal. In the meantime Ambrogio had arrived with a new consecrated Host and realized that that the Host was Bloody. He started to cry right away. All the people present saw the miracle. The notary public ran to call Mr. Argenta, confessor of the institute, the theologian Vaglio and Ferrero from the penitentiary, who were also witnesses to the miracle. At the same time even the other priests and three doctors arrived. The doctors Argenta, Volpini and Vercellone, attested to the fact the red stains were real Blood. Among the people there, one thought the Blood could come from the nose, or the mouth of the priest, but some surgeons present, after a meticulous observation, put the doubts to peace. Other clerical authorities intervened, and R. Bording, in agreement with everyone, wrote a report about the miracle. Another important proof of the authenticity of the miracle was furnished by a document which stated Monsignor Filippo Artico, Bishop of Asti, in 1841 had the cup and the consecrated Host examined by others who confirmed the origin of the red stains. The Opera Pia Milliavacca has kept the testimonies of the miracle. The cup with the Blood stains and the consecrated Host, unfortunately, have not been preserved well.",

The historian Fortunio thus describes the miracle in his noted work Annales Camalduenses: “It was the year 1412. The Camaldolese Abbey of Santa Maria in Bagno (then Priorato) was governed by Don Lorenzo, of Venetian origin. While he was celebrating the Divine Sacrifice, he mentally experienced, by diabolical influence, a strong doubt concerning the Real Presence of Jesus in the Most Holy Sacrament; when he then saw the Sacred Species of the wine flow over the chalice and fall onto the corporal in the form of living Blood, and thus the corporal remained soaked. It cannot be told how great was his emotion and perturbation of mind in that instant in the face of such a profound event. In tears, he turned to the bystanders, confessing his unbelief and the miracle which now had taken place before his eyes.” The monk Lazzaro was then transferred to Bologna as chaplain of the female Camaldolese convent of St. Christine, where he died in 1416. The Camaldolese held the Parish of Bagno until the Napoleonic suppression of 1808; from then the Parish-Basilica of St. Mary Assumed, after having been held for a brief period by the diocese of Sansepolcro, in 1975 passed definitively to become part of the diocese of Cesena. In 1912, Cardinal Gilio Boschi, Archbishop of Ferrara, celebrated the fifth centenary of the miracle, which was followed by a conference on Eucharistic studies. In 1958, His Excellency Domenico Bornigia, had a chemical analysis done on the marks of the corporal of the miracle at the University of Florence, which confirmed them to be of an ematic nature. In the basilica is found a colored and very rare incision on wood from 1400 called “The Madonna of the Blood,” which is found in the third chapel on the left. This image is thus named because, as Benedetto Tenaci, abbot of Bagno and eye witness of the miracle on May 20, 1948, tells us, the icon bled from the left arm. Every year, during the Feast of Corpus Christi, the corporal is carried in procession through the streets of the city and is exposed on every Sunday of the temperate season which lasts from March to November, at the Mass celebrated at 11 AM.",

While celebrating Holy Mass above the tomb of St. Christina (located in the church named for this martyr), he spoke the words of consecration and immediately Blood started to seep from the consecrated Host and trickle over his hands and onto the altar. At first the priest tried to hide the Blood, but eventually he interrupted the Mass and asked to be taken to the neighboring city of Orvieto, where Pope Urban IV resided. The Pope sent emissaries to investigate. When the facts were ascertained, he ordered the bishop of the diocese to bring the Host and the linen cloth bearing the stains of Blood to him. He had the relics placed in the cathedral. The linen bearing the spots of Blood is still reverently enshrined and exhibited in the Cathedral of Orvieto. Pope Urban IV was prompted by this miracle to commission St. Thomas Aquinas to compose the Office for the Mass and Liturgy of the Hours to celebrate the Most Holy Body of the Lord (Corpus Christi). One year after the miracle, in August of 1264, Pope Urban IV introduced Aquinus’s composition, and by means of a papal bull instituted the feast of Corpus Christi.",

There were many conversions among those who witnessed the miracle and to this day the townspeople of Canosio celebrate a feast during the Octave of Corpus Christi to commemorate the miracle.",
      "text": "Canosio is a small village in the region of Val Maira, in the Diocese of Saluzzo. In 1630, its townspeople had grown cold in their religious observance due to the spread of the Calvinistic heresy. A day after the feast of Corpus Christi, the river at Maira flooded because of a torrential rainfall. The flood waters were so violent and powerful that some massive stones were dislodged from the mountain and threatened to destroy the valley and the village itself! Father Antonio Reinardi , the pastor of the town, assembled the townspeople with the ringing of the church bells and exhorted them to pray that the Lord would stop the flood. He vowed that if the village of Canosio were spared from the flood’s destruction, the townspeople would celebrate in perpetuity an annual feast of Corpus Christi. Father Reinardi then placed the Sacrament in the monstrance. He processed towards the raging flood with some of the faithful as they all recited the \"Miserere\" Psalm 51. After he blessed the raging waters, the rain stopped at once and the flood waters peaked and returned to their normal level. This incident revived the faith of the townspeople of Canosio and to this day they observe the vow that was made. Unfortunately, many of the documents which attest to the miracle and which were preserved in the parish archives from the 17th century were burned during the war between France and Spain. What is extant, however, is a copy describing the events and which was left by the pastor who was a witness to what occurred.",

      "text": "At Cascia, in the basilica dedicated to St. Rita, is also preserved the relic of the Eucharistic Miracle, which happened near Siena in 1330. A priest was asked to bring Communion to a sick peasant. The priest took a consecrated Host which he irreverently placed in the pages of his breviary and went to the peasant. When he arrived at the house of the sick man, after hearing his confession, he opened the book to take out the Host which he had placed there. To his great surprise he found that the Host was stained with living blood, so much as to mark both pages between which the Blessed Sacrament had been placed. The priest, confused and penitent, went immediately to Siena to the Augustinian Priory to ask the counsel of Fr. Simone Fidati of Cascia, known by all to be a holy man. Fr. Fidati, having heard the story, granted pardon to the priest and asked to keep the two pages marked by Blood. Many popes have promoted veneration, conceding indulgences. In the act of recognition of the relic of the Eucharistic miracle of Cascia in 1687, a text was also reported of a very ancient code of the priory of St. Augustine in which are described numerous pieces of information regarding the miracle. Beyond this information, the episode is also mentioned in the Communal Statutes of Cascia of 1387 where it was ordered that “every year on the Feast of Corpus Christi, the authorities, the counsels, and the people of Cascia should meet in the Church of St. Augustine and follow the priest, who should carry the venerable relic of the Most Holy Body of Christ in procession through the city”. In 1930, on the occasion of the sixth centenary of the event, a Eucharistic Congress was celebrated at Cascia for the entire diocese of Norcia. A precious and artistic monstrance was consecrated, and the entire historical documentation of the miracle was published.",

      "text": "On March 28, 1171, the prior of the Canons Regular Portuensi, Father Pietro da Verona, was celebrating Easter Mass with three confreres (Bono, Leonardo and Aimone). At the moment of the breaking of the consecrated Host, Blood gushed forth from the Host and threw large drops on the ceiling of the small crypt above the altar. Histories tell of the “holy fear of the celebrant and of the immense wonder of the people who crowded the tiny church.” There were many eyewitnesses who told of seeing the Host take on a Bloody color and having seen in the Host the figure of a Baby. Bishop Amato of Ferrara and Archbishop Gherardo of Ravenna were immediately informed of the event. They witnessed with their own eyes the miracle, namely “the Blood which we saw redden the ceiling of the crypt.” The church immediately became a pilgrim destination, and later was rebuilt and expanded on the orders of Duke Ercole d’Este beginning in 1495. There are many sources regarding this miracle. Among the most important is the Bull of Pope Eugene IV (March 30, 1442), in which the pontiff mentions the miracle in reference to the testimonies of the faithful and ancient historical sources. The 1197 manuscript of Gerardo Cambrense, conserved in Canterbury’s Lambeth Library is the oldest document that mentions the miracle. The miracle received recent attention in the “Gemma Ecclesiastica” (Budding of the Church) by historian Antonio Samaritani. Another document which dates to March 6, 1404, is the Bull of Cardinal Migliorati, in which he grants indulgences to “those who visit the church and adore the Miraculous Blood.” Even today, on the 28th day of every month in the basilica, which is currently under the care of Saint Gaspare del Bufalo’s Missionaries of the Most Precious Blood, Eucharistic Adoration is celebrated in memory of the miracle. And every year, in preparation for the Feast of Corpus Christi, the solemn Forty Hours devotion is celebrated. The eighth centenary of the miracle was celebrated in 1971.",

The next day, returning to celebrate Mass in the same church, he found in the chalice drops of living Blood coagulated and incarnated. The Blood was immediately placed in a crystal cruet. The other Eucharistic miracle took place on Good Friday in 1595, when several fragments of the Host were miraculously unharmed in a church fire.",
      "text": "The first miracle took place on December 30, 1230. A priest named Uguccione, having finished celebrating Mass, did not realize that several drops of consecrated wine remained in the chalice and had turned into blood. The historian, Giovanni Villani, gives a precise description: “A day later, taking up the chalice, he found living blood coagulated […] and this was shown to all the women of the monastery and to all the locals who were present, to the bishop, and to all the clergy. And then the Precious Blood was revealed to all the Florentines, who gathered with great devotion to see. He took the Precious Blood from the chalice and put the Sacred Species in a crystal cruet and again showed the people, with great reverence.” Bishop Ardingo of Pavia ordered that the reliquary be brought to him. He kept the Precious Blood for several weeks before returning the miraculous Blood to the sisters of the monastery for safe-keeping near the Church of Saint Ambrose. Pope Boniface IX, in 1399, granted the same indulgence as the Portiuncula to those faithful who visited the Church of Saint Ambrose, and contributed to adorning the reliquary of the miracle. The 750th anniversary of the miracle was celebrated in 1980. The relic of the coagulated Blood (several drops of Blood that measure about a square centimeter) is conserved in a reliquary which has been placed inside a white marble tabernacle constructed by Mimo da Fiesole. On Good Friday in 1595, a lit candle on the altar of a side chapel called the Sepulchre, fell to the ground and started a fire. The people immediately rushed to put out the fire and succeeded in saving the Blessed Sacrament and chalice. In the great commotion, six fragments of consecrated Hosts fell from the pyx onto the smoldering carpet, but despite the fire these were found intact and joined together. In 1628, Archbishop Marzio Medici of Florence examined the fragments of the Hosts, which he found to be incorrupt. He had the Sacred Species placed in a precious reliquary. Every May during the Forty Hours devotion, the two reliquaries are exposed together in a reliquary that also contains a consecrated Host for public adoration.",

In 1294, a young housemaid went to the public wash-house of Versiola to wash the altar linens of the Church of St. Giusto in Gruaro. Suddenly, the woman noticed that a consecrated Host had remained by mistake among the folds of the cloth and that Blood was flowing from the Host. Frightened by this inexplicable event, she immediately ran to alert the pastor who then informed the Bishop of Concordia, Giacomo di Ottonello from Cividade. The Bishop, having learned the facts, asked to be able to keep the cloth of the miracle in his Cathedral in Concordia. However, the pastor of Gruaro and the family of the Counts of Valvasone, patrons of the churches of Gruaro and of Valvasone, wanted to keep the cloth. No agreement was reached, and so it was decided to seek recourse with the Holy See. In the end, Rome let the Counts keep the relic, on the condition that they would build a church dedicated to the Most Holy Body of Christ. The construction of the church was completed in 1483. The oldest and most authoritative document describing the miracle is a decree of Pope Nicholas V written in 1454. The title of the parish church, formerly St. Mary and St. John the Evangelist was thereby changed to the Church of the Most Holy Body of Christ (March 28, 1454). Today, the cloth is kept in a crystal cylinder, held by a precious reliquary of silver made by master craftsman Antonio Calligari. The celebration of the Holy Cloth is commemorated on the 5th Thursday of Lent, at the end of days of adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, with the participation of the priests and of the community of Valvasone.

On March 4, 1971, the professor presented a detailed report of the various studies carried out. Here are the basic results: 1- The “miraculous Flesh\" is authentic flesh consisting of muscular striated tissue of the myocardium. 2- The “miraculous Blood\" is truly blood. The chromatographic analysis indicated this with absolute and indisputable certainty. 3- The immunological study shows with certitude that the flesh and the blood are human, and the immuno – hematological test allows us to affirm with complete objectivity and certitude that both belong to the same blood type AB – the same blood type as that of the man of the Shroud and the type most characteristic of Middle Eastern populations. 4- The proteins contained in the blood have the normal distribution, in the identical percentage as that of the serous-proteic chart for normal fresh blood. 5- No histological dissection has revealed any trace of salt infiltrations or preservative substances used in antiquity for the purpose of embalming. Professor Linoli also discarded the hypothesis of a hoax carried out in past centuries. This report was published in The Sclavo Notebooks in Diagnostics (Collection #3, 1971) and aroused great interest in the scientific world. Also, in 1973, the chief Advisory Board of the World Health Organization appointed a scientific commission to corroborate Linoli’s findings. Their work lasted 15 months and included 500 tests. It was verified that the fragments taken from Lanciano could in no way be likened to embalmed tissue. As to the nature of the fragment of flesh, the commission declared it to be living tissue because it responded rapidly to all the clinical reactions distinctive of living beings. Their reply fully corroborated Professor Linoli’s conclusions. In the extract summarizing the scientific work of the Medical Commission of the WHO and the UN, published in Dec. 1976 in New York and Geneva, declared that science, aware of its limits, has come to a halt, face to face with the impossibility of giving an explanation.",

Furthermore, the historian Ferdinando Ughelli cited this miracle in his work Sacred Italy of 1647 and describes how since the fourteenth century “the corporal has been carried in solemn procession through the city, enclosed in an urn of crystal and silver, with the concourse of all Piceno.” All of the documents likewise agree in the description of how the miraculous facts occurred. An anonymous priest, during the Mass, was struck with strong doubts about the reality of the transubstantiation, and when he broke the Great Host, he saw blood drop from the Host and fall onto the corporal and chalice. The priest immediately informed Bishop Nicholas of San Martino, who ordered that the relic of the Blood-stained cloth be carried into the cathedral and he instituted a regular canonical process. In 1493 one of the first confraternities in honor of the Most Blessed Sacrament was instituted at Macerata (1494) and it was here that the pious practice of Forty Hours was established in 1556.

After the consecration he began distributing Holy Communion to the faithful. At a certain point, he saw in the Communion line two men who were well-known for the dissolute lives they led. The pastor gave them Holy Communion and as soon as they had taken the Host in their mouths, they spit the Holy Eucharist out on the stone floor below the altar rail. The two men justified themselves by saying that the Hosts had become as hot as burning embers, and that the Blessed Sacrament was burning their tongues. Then, taken by remorse at not first having gone to Confession, they ran away. Father Salvatore went to gather the Sacred Hosts that had fallen and saw that the imprints of the Sacred Hosts remained in the stone as if they had been sculpted there. He ordered the stone to be thoroughly washed in the hope that the imprints would be erased. But every attempt failed miserably. Many historians, including Father Pietro Cossu and Father Casu, described the findings made by the bishop at that time, Antonio Surredo, and by his successors. Among the most important documents that confirm the miracle is a public act written by the notary Pedro Antonio Escano on May 25, 1686, in which the rector of Mogoro stipulates a contract for the construction of a wooden tabernacle over the main altar. At the base of the tabernacle, there was to be an opening for the “stone of the miracle,” which was to be enclosed in a decorative case and placed in such a way that the faithful could see it.

      "text": "In Morrovalle, at about two o’clock in the morning of April 17, 1560, during the octave of Easter, Brother Angelo Blasi awoke with a start at the sound of violent crackling. Looking out the window of his cell, he saw the church was completely engulfed in flames, and he immediately ran to notify the other brothers. The fire was extinguished after seven hours, and in the following days began the work of clearing the massive pile of church ruins. On April 27, Father Battista da Ascoli was removing a piece of marble from what used to be the main altar and discovered the pyx in a wall cavity. Its corporal was scorched but the consecrated Host was still intact and in good condition. Father Battista shouted at the sight of the miracle, and many people immediately ran to the marvelous sight. For three entire days, the Blessed Sacrament was exposed for public adoration. When Franciscan provincial Father Evangelista da Morro d’Alba finally arrived, the miraculous Host was placed in an ivory case. The then-bishop of Bertinoro, Ludovico di Forli, was immediately sent by Pope Pius IV to Morrovalle to investigate the authenticity of the event. As soon as he received the bishop’s account, Pope Pius IV judged the occurrence to be without natural cause, and he authorized public devotion with the Bull “Holy Roman Church” (1560). The Bull proclaims the anniversaries of the fire and the discovery of the sacred Host (April 17 and 27) as feasts with plenary indulgences (so that they were known locally as the feasts “of the two pardons”). Because of the many faithful who came to the celebrations, the church was later expanded. Today, the feasts are celebrated with exposition of the Blessed Sacrament and of the pyx on the main altar. The pardons, namely the plenary indulgences, are available at the church of Saint Bartholomew. The miraculous Host was conserved intact until 1600 but due to the vicissitudes of history every trace of it was later lost.

      "text": "In 1273 in the town of Lanciano, a woman named Richiarella went to a witch and asked her how she could recover the affection of her husband, Giacomo Stasio. Following the witch’s advice, she went to Communion to obtain a consecrated Host. She returned home and put the Host on the fire in an earthenware jar with the intention of turning the Blessed Sacrament into powder to put into her husband’s food. The Particles, however, were transformed into living Flesh. Richiarella, horrified by these events, wrapped the jar and the Bloodied Host in a linen handkerchief that she then buried under the manure in her husband’s stable. Strange events began to take place inside the stable: every time Giacomo’s donkey entered, it would genuflect toward the place where the miraculous Host was buried, and Giacomo began to think that his wife had put a spell on the beast. Seven years later, Ricchiarella remorsefully confessed her terrible sacrilege to the prior of the Augustinian priory in Lanciano, Giacomo Diotallevi, a native of Offida. According to the oldest stories, the woman, in tears, began screaming, “I killed God! I killed God!” The priest went to the place, found the bundle with the relics, and gave them to his fellow-citizens. A cross-shaped reliquary was made to contain the Host. An ancient story recounts that two monks, Brother Michele and a confrere, were invited to Venice. When they arrived, they made the craftsman promise with an oath of loyalty “that he would not reveal to anyone what he was about to see and place inside the cross. Having taken the oath, the craftsman took the pyx containing the miraculous Host, but, struck with a sudden fever, exclaimed, ‘What have you brought me, Oh my Brother?’ The religious then asked him if he was in mortal sin. The craftsman answered, ‘Yes’, made his confession to the same priest and, the fever having left him, he took the pyx without any danger. Without extracting the Host, he fixed both Host and pyx, together with the sacred wood, inside the same cross, with a crystal above it, as you can clearly see.” The reliquaries of the jar and the Blood-stained linen with the cross containing the miraculous Host are exposed in the Church of St. Augustine in Offida. Richiaretta’s house was transformed into a small chapel. In 1973, the seventh centenary of the miracle was celebrated, and every year on May 3rd, the citizens of Offida celebrate the anniversary of the miracle.",

However the Sacred Hosts were completely intact. The appearance of mysterious lights and a dove made it possible to see where the Hosts were buried. Saint Alphonsus Liguori described this miracle in detail and took the opportunity to reawake the faith and devotion of the people towards the Eucharist. The Vicar General, Monsignor Onorati drew up the minutes of the diocesan trial which lasted two years from 1772 to 1774. In the minutes it was stated that the appearance of the lights and the intact preservation of the consecrated Hosts “has been and is an authentic miracle operated by God to illustrate more and more the truth of the Catholic dogma and increase the worship towards the Real Presence of Christ in the Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist.” Among the various testimonies there were also those of three renowned scientists of the time among which was Dr. Domenico Cotugno of the Royal University of Naples and they all agreed in saying that “The intact preservation of the Hosts cannot be explained with physical principles and they surpass the power of natural agents. Therefore, they must be considered as miraculous.” In 1972 Professor Pietro De Franciscis, teacher of human physiology at the University of Naples confirmed the above statement. In 1967, Cardinal Corrado Ursi, on the occasion of the elevation of the Church of St. Peter to a diocesan Eucharistic Sanctuary said “The prodigious event of St. Peter is a gift and a divine warning for the whole archdiocese. Its voice must never weaken but must urge the faithful of all times to consider the message regarding the ‘Bread of Life for the salvation of the world’ launched by Christ at Cafarnas.”",

This episode is also cited in Begninitas, considered one of the most ancient sources regarding the life of Saint Anthony. “This saintly man was speaking with a faithless heretic who was opposed to the sacrament of the Eucharist and whom the saint had nearly led to the Catholic faith. But, after numerous arguments, this heretic declared: ‘If you, Anthony, produce a miracle and demonstrate to me that the Body of Christ is truly Communion, I will completely renounce my heresy and immediately convert to the Catholic faith. Why don’t we have a wager? I’ll keep one of my beasts locked up for three days to feel the torments of hunger. Then I will bring it forth in public and show it food. You will stand in front of it with what you maintain is the Body of Christ. If the beast, leaving aside its food, hurries to adore its God, I will share the faith of your Church.’” Saint Anthony, illuminated and inspired from above, accepted the challenge. At the chosen day and hour, the priest and heretic entered the Grand Piazza (today the Three Martyrs Piazza). Saint Anthony was followed by Catholic faithful; Bonovillo (this was the name of the Catharist heretic) by his allies in unbelief. The saint held between his hands the consecrated Host, contained in a monstrance; the heretic held his hungry mule. The saint, after having requested and obtained silence, turned to the mule with these words: “In virtue and in the name of your Creator, Who I, as unworthy as I am, hold in my hands, I tell and order you: Come forward immediately and render homage to the Lord with all due respect so that heretics and evildoers will understand that all creatures must humble themselves before their Creator whom priests hold in their hands at the altar.” And immediately the animal, refusing the food offered by its master, docilely approached the priest. It bent its front legs before the Host and paused there reverently. Anthony’s adversary was true to his word, and threw himself at the saint’s feet denouncing publicly the errors of his ways. From that day, he became one of the most zealous cooperators of the miracle-working saint.",

In June of that year, another stunning and unexpected miracle occurred – the flow of blood. These events occurred repeatedly between 1948 and 1950 and were corroborated by many eyewitnesses, by the nuns themselves and particularly by the abbess, Mother Ildegarde Cabitza of holy memory. In the monastery archives are preserved many sworn testimonies even of priests, preachers and visitors, together with medical analyses of the blood, as well as finger towels and purificators soaked with blood. One of the most endearing testimonies is that of Monsignor Angelo Scapecchi, who later became Auxiliary Bishop of the Diocese of Arezzo. From the archives we learn of the investigation of the Visitator, Father Luigi Romoli, O.P., sent by the Holy Office, who personally interrogated all the nuns, imposing the strictest secrecy on the community. Subsequently, on November 14, 1950, the Holy Office ordered the statue to be removed so as to keep it in a secret location. It was brought back to Rosano in 1952. The community of nuns of Rosano lived these events with intimate joy and great devotion but with great reserve; so much so that, as we learn from the chronicles, they were not distracted from their daily duties. On the contrary, they lived their monastic life even more intensely according to the Benedictine motto: Ora et Labora. The weeping and the flow of blood were considered inexplicable from a natural and human point of view. My venerable predecessor, Bishop Giovanni Giorgis, saw in these events of Rosano an appeal from the Lord ‘to fidelity, reparation and prayer.’ […] Beloved brothers and sisters, with great devotion and pride let us look back on the events that took place in our diocese fifty years ago and see them as signs of the Lord’s benevolence and love and an invitation to a serious and profound reflection. With great ardor let us joyfully renew our devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. And as we receive this message, let us ask for the gift of an ever deeper conversion to His love, for the grace of an increase of apostolic fervor, as well as for the gift of numerous holy vocations to the priesthood and religious life, so as to make Christ the Heart of the world. Looking at the Heart of Jesus, we will joyfully draw life from the fountain of salvation!”",

Giving in to a horrible temptation, a woman was about to take the Eucharistic Bread home to use the Sacred Species for sorcery. But a priest noticed what she had done and ran after her, taking away from her the Host she had sacrilegiously stolen. Then he unfolded the white linen cloth in which the sacred Host had been wrapped and found that the Host had been transformed in such a way that Half had become visibly the Body of Christ, while the other Half preserved the normal look of a Host. With such a clear testimony, God wanted to win over unbelievers and heretics who refused to accept the Real Presence of the Eucharistic mystery: in one half of the consecrated bread the Body of Christ was visible, while in the other the natural form, thus highlighting the reality of the sacramental transubstantiation taking place at the Consecration.”",

Here it is narrated about how a certain “Priest by the name of Lorenzo was called with urgency to administer the Holy Viaticum on the western confines of the parish, between Zeminiana and Briana, to a moribund ill person. The season and the hour were not suited for a procession, so the priest had to be satisfied with only one altar boy. Arriving at the meadows surrounding the Muson River, commonly called Cime, several donkeys that were grazing faced themselves in the direction of the pius convoy and, after approaching the priest, they bowed on their knees and then followed the Most Holy Sacrament all the way to the home of the infirm, renewing the genuflection; and then, always with Father Lorenzo, they returned, stopping in the pasture….

Gerola in “The Book for All,” P. Beccaro in “Close to Jesus,” and P. Sanna Solaro, S.I. in a publication about Eucharistic events that occurred in Italy. The wondrous marvel was also referred to the Eucharistic Congress of Milan and it was also desired to illustrate it in the one of Venice, according to the correspondence of 1897, preserved in the parish archive. In the History of the Society of Jesus, by Nicolò Orlandino, printed in Bologna by Bartolomeo Zanetti in 1615, again the episode is recounted. This story was written by the Servant of God Simone Rodriguez, a man equipped with extensive knowledge, who died in the odor of sanctity in Lisbon Portugal, on the 15th of July 1579. To this document the Curia attached also a notice that confirms the name of the priest spectator of the Miracle, which served to determine even more the date of the Miracle. Father Lorenzo was indeed Chaplain of the Church of Salzano precisely in the month of August in 1517; and he was summoned to the Curia to testify on questions about the parish, which at that time was held by Don Francesco Artuso, who was the pastor in that place until about 1550. The Miracle was concluded to have occurred in the year 1517, and Father Rodriguez, who surely spoke with Don Artuso, was allowed to examine the verbal proceedings, drafted by the competent authorities of that time.",

After three days, on August 17th, the 351 consecrated Hosts were found intact in the dust of the alms box of the sanctuary of Santa Maria in Provengano. The entire population celebrated the finding of the consecrated Hosts which were immediately taken back to the church of San Francesco in a solemn procession. With the passing of time the Hosts did not change in appearance. Many times, distinguished men examined them with every means available and the conclusions were always the same: “The Sacred Hosts are still fresh, intact, uncorrupted, chemically pure, and do not present any sign of alteration”. In 1914, Pope St. Pius X authorized a test which was attended by many professors of health, chemistry and pharmaceutics, among whom was also the well-known Professor Siro Grimaldi. The final conclusion of the edited report of the test stated: “The Sacred Hosts of Siena are the classic example of the perfect conservation of particles from unleavened bread, consecrated in the year 1730, and constitute a unique and most interesting phenomenon which reverses the natural laws of conservation of organic matter… It is strange, surprising, abnormal… the laws of nature have been reversed. In the glass there was mold, the unleavened bread has been more refractory of the crystal [...] it is a unique fact contained in the annals of science.” Additional tests were done in 1922, on the occasion of the transfer of the Hosts in a cylinder of pure crystal, in 1950 and 1951. Pope John Paul II, during a visit in the city of Siena on September 14, 1980, said regarding the Hosts: “It is the Real Presence!” The permanent miracle of the Sacred Hosts is kept in the Chapel Piccolimini in the summer months, and in the Chapel Martinozzi in the winter months. Numerous are the initiatives that induce the citizens of Siena in honor of the Sacred Hosts: the tribute of the political districts, the respect of children having recently made their First Holy Communion, the solemn procession in the celebration of Corpus Christi, the Eucharistic ceremony at the end of September, the day of Eucharistic adoration on the 17th of each month in memory of the recovery of the Sacred Hosts on August 17, 1730.",

There are numerous documents which retell this miracle; among them are Eucharistic monograms, which are on the ancient streets of the city. Brother Bartolomeo Campi describes in his work, “L’Inamorato di Gesù Cristo” (1625), an accurate account of the unfolding of the facts: “Pretending to be Christian, the woman received Communion with the others… and took the consecrated Host from her mouth and transferred the Holy Eucharist to a handkerchief. Once home she wanted to experiment with whether or not the Blessed Sacrament was bread and put the consecrated Host into a heated frying pan filled with oil. Upon contact with the boiling oil, the consecrated Host miraculously became Bloody Flesh and a hemorrhage, so to speak, would not stop flowing and went from the pan all over the cursed woman and her house. Terrorized, the woman began to scream… and the neighbors ran over to find out the reasons behind her cries…”. The archbishop was immediately informed of the events and he ordered the return of the consecrated Host to the church. That same Cistercian Abbot Ferdinando Ughelli (1670), in his well-known encyclopedic work “Italia Sacra”, wrote in a notation of his seventh volume: “In Trani a sacred Host was fried to the dismay of our Faith…, the true Flesh and Blood of Christ was unveiled in the unleavened Bread which fell to the ground”. An indirect confirmation to this miracle is also found in the affirmation of St. Pio from Pietreclina, which exclaimed: “Trani is fortunate to have been bathed by the Blood of Christ twice”, the first reference being to this miracle and the later to the miracle of the Colonna Crucifix from which an abundant stream of blood flowed from Jesus’ nose. Thanks to the generosity of the nobleman Ottavian Campitelli, the house of the woman was converted into a chapel in 1706. In 1616 the relic of the Host was transferred to an antique silver shrine donated by Fabrizio de Cunio. Throughout various eras, many tests were performed on this sacred relic and verified, the last one took place in 1924 at the Inter-diocesan Eucharistic Congress headed by Monsignor Giuseppe Maria Leo.",

      "summary": "Inside the Corpus Domini Basilica in Turin, there is an iron railing that closes in the place where, in 1453, the first Eucharistic miracle of Turin occurred. An inscription inside the railing describes the miracle: “Here the she-mule that was carrying the Divine Body fell prostrate; here the Sacred Host was miraculously freed from the bag containing the Sacred Species and rose high; here came gently down among the suppliant hands of the people of Turin; here then, the place made holy by the miracle. Remembering, pray on your knees. (June 6, 1453)”. Then suddenly the bag opened and the monstrance with the consecrated Host rose over the surrounding houses while the people were filled with wonder.",
      "text": "In the Alta Val Susa, close to Exilles, the army of René D'Angiò met the army of the duke Ludovic of Savoy. Here the soldiers indulged in plundering the town and some of them entered the church. One of them forced open the little door of the tabernacle and stole the monstrance with the consecrated Host. He wrapped up all that he had stolen in a bag and headed for Turin on a mule. On the main plaza close to St. Sylvester’s Church (now the Holy Spirit Church, where later the Church of Corpus Domini was built), the she-mule stumbled and fell. Then suddenly the bag fell open and the monstrance with the consecrated Host rose over the surrounding houses while the people were filled with wonder. Among those present there was also Don Bartholomew Coccolo. He ran with this news to the Bishop, Ludovic of the Romagnano’s Marquises. The Bishop, accompanied by a cortege of people and clergy, went to the plaza, prostrated himself in adoration and prayed with the words of the Emmaus disciples, “Stay with us, Lord”. Meanwhile a new miracle had happened; the monstrance had fallen on the ground, leaving the consecrated Host free and shining as a second sun. The Bishop who was holding a chalice in his hands lifted it up high, and the consecrated Host slowly started coming down and settled in the chalice. The devotion for the miracle of 1453 was at once adopted by the town that first promoted the building of an aedicule on the place of the miracle, and then soon substituted by the church dedicated to the Corpus Domini. But the most significant display of this is expressed by the celebrations organized in occasion of the centenaries and fiftieth anniversaries (1653, 1703, 1853, and partially 1803). The documents that describe the miracles are many. The most ancient are the three Capitulary Acts of 1454, 1455 and 1456, and some writings contemporary of the Turin Municipality. In 1853 the Blessed Pope Pius IX solemnly celebrated the fourth centenary of the miracle. In this celebration Saint John Bosco and Don Rua participated. Furthermore, Pius IX on this occasion approved the Office and the Mass Proper of the miracle for the Turin archdiocese. In 1928 Pius XI raised the Church of Corpus Domini to the dignity of minor basilica. In the XV century the Holy See gave the order to consume the Host of the miracle, “to not oblige God to make the miracle an eternal miracle by keeping always incorrupt, as they had being doing, those very same Eucharistic species”.",

Friar Pier Maria da Cambiano, a Capuchin friar, describes in great detail the Eucharistic miracle that occurred during the French troops’ occupation of the Church of Santa Maria del Monte. The region of Piedmont was overrun with foreign troops. After Casale Monferrato was liberated from the Spaniards, the French advanced to Turin. On May 6, 1640 they arrived at Chieri, on the 7th at Moncalieri, and on the 10th they finally reached Turin. Having occupied the left bank of the Po River, they launched an offensive attack and gained control of the bridge. From there they advanced to the Capuchin Monastery of the Monte. However, it was not that secure a position. On the morning of May 12, they launched a double attack on the trenches. They were twice repelled. On the third assault, however, our troops were compelled to lay down their arms and flee with the civilian population to seek shelter and safety in the sanctuary of a holy place the church. The invaders, nevertheless, entered the church and slaughtered the men and women, the young and the old, civilians and troops alike; even those who braced themselves onto the altars or who took refuge in the arms of the Capuchin friars. They pleaded for their lives and for their freedom. None of the friars were wounded but their hearts were distraught at the sight of so much bloodshed and carnage. The soldiers trashed sacred vessels and vestments and they sacked the friary since the refugees had stored some of their household items and furniture for safe keeping. And after, in the church itself (too horrible to recount!) they committed brutal acts of debauchery! As if all that were not enough, a French soldier, who was an unbeliever, climbed onto the altar and forced open the tabernacle to seize the ciborium and the sacred Hosts it held in order to desecrate the Hosts. And then, a miracle!! A flame of fire blazed out of the ciborium directly onto the sacrilegious Frenchman; it scorched his uniform and his face! The terrified soldier threw himself to the floor screaming and asking God's forgiveness. The church was suddenly filled with dense smoke. Between the terror and the astonishment felt by all, the vandalism ceased!",

Today, the chalice where the Blessed Sacrament was exposed is kept in the same Church of St. Erasmus and is used once a year at the celebration of Mass on Easter Tuesday.",
      "text": "At Easter in 1570 in the Church of St. Erasmus, the consecrated Host, according to the traditional rite at the time, was placed in a round silver container (pyx) and placed in a burse-like holder. This was later placed in a large, ceremonial silver chalice with its paten; the whole wrapped in an elegant silk cloth. It should be mentioned that at that time exposition of the Blessed Sacrament in a monstrance was not a widespread practice, even though the Council of Cologne (1452) specifically referred to the monstrance. It was the custom for each civil confraternity to be present for an hour of adoration before the exposed Blessed Sacrament. It was at one of these hours of adoration which had the members of the Confraternity of Mercy (which predated both the Confraternity of Corpus Christi and of our Blessed Lady) vested in their black robes and kneeling in prayer. The most authentic document about this Eucharistic miracle was taken immediately by the chancery. This document is preserved in the archives of the Church of St. Erasmus. The detailed deposition and account of the miraculous event is given by a Giacomo Meloni who was among the first witnesses. His testimony follows: \"Raising my eyes towards the chalice, I saw a most brilliant star at the base of the chalice’s cup, and above the star, the Blessed Sacrament in the size of the Host used by the priest at Mass. The star was attached to the Blessed Sacrament (...). The vision ended when small children in adoration, similar to small angels, were seen around the Sacred Host...\". To this day, this miraculous event is commemorated with solemn ceremony in the presence of the bishop. The chalice, its paten, and the silver pyx where the Blessed Sacrament was exposed, have all been preserved and they remain with the relics/ reliquaries of the saints. The Sacred Species (the consecrated Bread) of the miraculous Host of Veroli was consumed after 112 years. In 1970 on the occasion of the fourth centenary of the miracle, the Third Eucharistic Congress of the Diocese of Veroli-Frosinone was celebrated. The adoration of the Blessed Sacrament takes place every First Friday of the month, with all other churches being closed (...).",

As soon as he left the Church, taken by a fit of fury against the sacramental Jesus, he threw the ciborium with its precious content against a Church wall.

      "text": "Among the principal causes that unchained the pointless Allumiere war, which finished with the sacking of Volterra in 1472 by the army of the Duke of Montefeltro, were above all, the contrast that existed between the different social classes and the personal interests of Lorenzo di Medici. Absorbed by the Florentian state, Volterra was subjected to harsh treatment, which caused the emigration of many wealthy families and the appropriation of their goods at bankruptcy prices. It was in this historical scenario that in 1472 our Eucharistic miracle was verified. Among the most authoritative witnesses that describe the miracle, we have the written relation of Friar Biagio Lisci, who was a direct witness. The relation is now kept in the archives of the Church of Saint Francis. We also have some municipal acts preserved in the municipal library of Volterra. A soldier from Florence entered the Cathedral Church and immediately went to the tabernacle, from which he took the ciborium with consecrated Hosts inside, along with many sacred objects. As soon as he left the Church, taken by a very strong hatred against Jesus in the Eucharist, the soldier flung the ciborium against one of the external walls of the Church and all the Sacred Hosts came out from it, which - as if held by an invisible hand - were elevated into the air, all radiant with light. The soldier fell to the ground out of fright, and having repented, began to cry. Many were the witnesses who were present at this marvel.",

Alejo Zavala Castro, Bishop of the Diocese of Chilpancingo-Chilapa, announced through a Pastoral Letter the recognition of the Eucharistic Miracle that occurred at Tixtla, on October 21, 2006. In the letter we read: “This manifestation brings to us a marvelous sign of the love of God that confirms the Real presence of Jesus in the Eucharist... In my role as Bishop of the Diocese I recognize the supernatural character of the series of events relating to the Bleeding Host of Tixtla... I declare the case as a “Divine Sign ...”. “The ecclesiastical authority wanted likewise to specify that in a Catholic context the Miracle distinguishes itself for the following aspects: 1- Theological: The intervention comes from God. It is of divine origin. 2- Objectivity: The ‘alteration’ of the causes or natural laws is evident. 3- Subjectivity: Whoever accepts the miracle ‘recognizes or accepts’ with an act of Faith that the extraordinary event comes from the loving Will of God. 4- Purpose: It has as its end the good of one or many people.”",
      "text": "On October 21, 2006, the effusion of a reddish substance was noted from a consecrated Host during the Eucharistic Celebration at Tixtla, in the Diocese of Chilpancingo-Chilapa. The Bishop of the place, Most Reverend Alejo Zavala Castro, then convened a Theological Commission of investigation and, in October 2009, he invited Doctor Ricardo Castañón Gómez, to take on the leadership of the program of scientific research whose purpose was in fact that of verifying the said event. The Mexican Ecclesiastical authorities turned to Doctor Castañón Gómez because they were aware that, in the years 1999-2006, the scientist had conducted some studies on two consecrated Hosts that also bled in the Parish of Saint Mary, in Buenos Aires. The Mexican case starts in October 2006, when Father Leopoldo Roque, pastor of the Parish of Saint Martin of Tours, invites Father Raymundo Reyna Esteban to lead a spiritual retreat for his parishioners. As Father Leopoldo and another priest were distributing Communion, assisted by a religious sister who was to the left of Father Raymundo, this latter one turns towards him with the “pix” containing the Sacred Particles, looking at Father with eyes filled with tears, an incident that immediately attracted the attention of the celebrant: the Host that she had taken to give Communion to a lady parishioner had begun to effuse a reddish substance. The scientific research conducted between October 2009 and October 2012 came to the following conclusions, presented on May 25, 2013 during the course of an international Symposium held by the Diocese of Chilpancingo, on the occasion of the Year of Faith, and which saw the participation of millions of people coming from four continents “1- The reddish substance analyzed corresponds to blood in which there are hemoglobin and DNA of human origin. 2- Two studies conducted by eminent forensic experts with different methodologies have shown that the substance originates from the interior, excluding the hypothesis that someone could have placed it from the exterior. 3- The blood type is AB, similar to the one found in the Host of Lanciano and in the Holy Shroud of Turin. A microscopic analysis of magnification and penetration reveals that the superior part of the blood has been coagulated since October 2006. Moreover, the underlying internal layers reveal, in February 2010, the presence of fresh blood. 4- They also found intact white blood cells, red blood cells, and active macrophages that engulf lipids. The tissue in question appears lacerated and with recovery mechanisms, exactly as occurs in a living tissue. 5- A further histopathological analysis determines the presence of protein structures in a state of deterioration, suggesting mesenchymal cells, very specialized cells, characterized by an elevated biophysiological dynamism. 6- The immunohistochemical studies reveal that the tissue found corresponds to the muscle of the heart (Myocardium). On account of the scientific results and the conclusions reached by the theological committee, last October 12 the Bishop of Chilpancingo, his Eminence Alejo Zavala Castro, announced the following: - The event does not have a natural explanation. - It does not have paranormal origin. - It is not traceable to manipulation of the enemy.”",

But the miracle continued: three times the priest had to return to Ysbrand’s house to recover the Host that miraculously re-appeared there. It was then decided to turn Ysbrand Dommer’s house into a chapel. On Easter Sunday, everyone who had witnessed the miracle, and the mayor of Amstel, compiled a report of the events.

The flames quickly spread everywhere and reached the interior of the church. Not knowing what to do, the elderly pastor, Jan Hocaerts, immediately ran to warn the neighbors. A group of the faithful led by Jan Baloys, decided to try to rescue the Blessed Sacrament. It was impossible to enter the church and the only solution left was for someone to be lowered down through the window. Jan Baloys volunteered. After breaking the glass of the large window near the altar with a bar, he let himself down inside. With great amazement, he saw that the flames which had already destroyed the whole church were being kept away from the area around the tabernacle. Jan then opened the tabernacle, grabbed the ciborium containing the consecrated Hosts, and carried them to safety. Everyone immediately shouted, “Miracle!”. The church was later rebuilt and the Hosts remained intact until 1557. Because of historical vicissitudes and religious wars, every trace of them was subsequently lost.",

      "text": "The first apparition of the Divine Child in the Most Holy Sacrament took place on the night of June 2, 1649, during the Vespers and the solemn exposition in honor of the feast of Corpus Christi. At the end of the service, the Franciscan monk Jerome de Silva Manrique, was about to return the monstrance to the tabernacle, but he suddenly stopped. In the Host there appeared the brilliant face of a Child, framed by thick brown curls falling to the shoulders. All the faithful present in the church observed the same vision. The second apparition took place a few days later, on July 22nd of the same year, during the celebrations in honor of St. Mary of Magdalene, Patroness of the city. According to the testimony of Brother Marco Lopez, superior of the convent in Chiclayo, during the exposition of the Most Holy Sacrament, “The Divine Child Jesus again appeared in the Host, dressed in a purple tunic. Beneath it he wore a shirt up to the middle of the chest, according to the custom of the South American Indians.” Through this sign, the Divine Child wanted to identify with the Mochican inhabitants of Eten, to demonstrate His love for them. In the same apparition, which lasted about 15 minutes, many also saw appearing in the Host three small white hearts, united among themselves. These symbolized the Three Persons of the Holy Trinity: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, present in the consecrated Host. To this day, the feast in honor of the miracle of the Divine Child of Eten, continues to attract thousands of faithful yearly.",

The Lithuanian’s troops destroyed the village and the church. None of the survivors knew about the hidden Host. Only a number of years later, while plowing the field in the spring, a farmer found it by chance, thanks to the strange behavior of his oxen. They had bowed to the ground in adoration of the Host which was emanating a very bright light.",
      "text": "The most ancient documents describe how the miracle happened. The oxen were pulling the plow, behind which the farmer was walking. The sun was setting at the horizon, creating long shadows. The man lifted his eyes and prodded the animals which were going slowly up the hill. All of sudden, the plow got stuck, the oxen pulled harder and on the side they turned over a big clod of earth. The animals stopped as if frozen. At first the farmer scolded the beasts, yet paused surprised at the sudden change around him. The light on the field was as if it were noon and a very intense light was coming from the ground shining on the kneeling oxen. The farmer began to dig and noticed that the bright light was coming from a little ciborium covered with dirt. It contained a perfect Host as white as snow. The news of the extraordinary event spread rapidly among the people, who rushed immediately to the site. The local authorities organized a solemn procession to bring the Host to the church of Dobre Miasto, though according to an ancient chronicle, inexplicably, the Host disappeared and was found at the same spot as the first time. The event was interpreted as a sign from above and a little church dedicated to the Corpus Christi was built on that location. The popularity of Glotowo grew through the centuries and in the eighteenth century the old medieval church was enlarged and consecrated by the bishop Krzysztof Potocki, on July 24, 1726. Even today, every year, the shrine of Glotowo attracts numerous pilgrims who come to venerate the relic of the Host, intact since 1290.",

They forced their way into the tabernacle and stole the monstrance, which contained consecrated Hosts. They got away, but when they figured out that the monstrance was not made of real gold, they threw it (including the Hosts) into the muddy marshland that was prevalent in the area. Priests from the church began a search, but they did not hold out much hope. When darkness fell, however, a mysterious light emanated from the spot where the treasure had been abandoned. Bright flashes of light were visible for several kilometers. Frightened villagers approached the area and reported back to the Bishop of Krakow. The bishop called for three days of fasting and prayer. On the third day, he led a procession out to the marsh. There, they found the monstrance, and within it they found the Hosts, which were unbroken and were the source of the unusual lights. The people began to pray and to celebrate the miracle. Annually on the occasion of the feast of Corpus Christi, the miracle is celebrated in the church of Corpus Christi in Krakow.",

It was immediately placed in a container with water and closed in the tabernacle. St. Hyacinth’s priest, Father Andrzej Ziombra, said that on January 4th, along with other priests, he went to see if the consecrated Host had dissolved in the water after nearly two weeks: \"Immediately we noticed that the Host had not dissolved, and that a red spot covering a fifth of Its surface appeared. We decided to inform the Bishop, who established a special theological scientific commission to analyze the event. We noticed that over time the stain on the Host changed color from deep red to red brown (...). The sample was taken directly by the scientists on 26 January 2014. For the priests the miracle was evident. The commission checked if It was some fungus, mold or another external agent (...). The Wrocław Forensic Medicine Institute immediately excluded the presence of bacteria or fungi as a cause for the Host turning red. A second histopathological analysis pointed out that some fragments seemed to belong to myocardial tissue. An additional opinion was sought using the same samples at the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Szczecin without specifying where the samples came from. The Institute used a different analysis method. After the analysis, The Pomeranian Medical University’s Department of Histopathology in Szczecin announced that “tissue fragments containing fragmented parts of cross-striated muscle” was found in the histopathological image. This is similar to “human heart muscle with alterations that often appear during the agony. We have not tested the blood found on the Host, we only know that human DNA was found.” The results of the analysis were presented to the Vatican’s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which recognised the supernatural nature of the event. It is striking that the examination results were similar to those of the Lanciano Eucharistic Miracle of 700 A.D. and other Miracles that occurred recently such as Sokolka in 2008, in Poland, Tixtla in 2006 in Mexico, and Buenos Aires, in Argentina in 1996. On April 17, 2016, following the instructions received by the Holy See, Monsignor Zbigniew Kiernikowskiego, the new Bishop of Legnica, announced during Mass that the parish priest Fr Andrzej Ziombra should \"prepare a suitable place for the exhibition of the precious relic, so that the faithful can express their adoration properly\".",

      "text": "In the city of Poznan, profaners with an intense hatred for the Christian faith persuaded a domestic helper to take three consecrated Hosts from the Dominican (now Jesuit) church. The woman, enticed by a large reward, succeeded in stealing three Hosts. Immediately after they received the Hosts, the malefactors went to the basement of their mansion, put the Hosts on a table and desecrated the Eucharist, piercing the Hosts with pointed instruments. Suddenly, a copious amount of Blood began to drip from the Hosts, which splashed the face of a girl afflicted with blindness, and she immediately regained her sight. The desecrators, seized with panic and anxiety, tried to destroy the Hosts, which nevertheless remained whole. Unable to rid themselves of the Holy Eucharist, they decided to take the Hosts outside the city and cast the Sacred Species into a marsh in the vicinity of the Warta River. A young shepherd who happened to be passing near the marsh saw the three luminous Hosts suspended in the air. Holding back his emotions, he returned home and recounted everything to his father and the local authorities. The burgomaster was indifferent to the young man's account and ordered him to be jailed. The young shepherd managed to mysteriously escape and again presented himself to the burgomaster, who finally convinced of the facts, made his way to the place of the miracle. In the meantime, the entire population had gathered around the three luminous Hosts suspended in the air. Only Bishop Wojciech Jastrzebiec, after beseeching Heaven with fervent prayers, succeeded in recovering the Hosts, which descended into the pyx he held in his hands. The bishop immediately directed that a solemn procession be formed to accompany the miraculous Hosts to St. Mary Magdalene Church. At the site of the miracle, a wooden chapel was constructed which became the goal for many pilgrimages. King Wladyslaw Jagiello came to know of the miracle and made a trip to Poznan to venerate the miraculous Hosts. As a sign of devotion, the king ordered that a church dedicated to the Body of Christ (Corpus Domini) be built at the exact spot where the miracle occurred. In the 19th century, in place of the old mansion where the profanation of the Hosts took place, a shrine was constructed where even today the table with the imprints from the Blood that dripped from the Hosts has been preserved. Every Thursday a procession with the Blessed Sacrament takes place at Corpus Domini Church to recall the miracle.",

      "summary": "On October 12, 2008, at the church dedicated to Saint Anthony of Sokółka, the Holy Mass of 8:30 AM is celebrated by a young vicar, Filip Zdrodowski. During Communion, unknowingly the Host falls from the hands of one of the priests. A woman kneeling, ready to receive the Eucharist, makes him notice it. The priest remains paralyzed from fright and believing it was dirty, places it in the vasculum, a small silver vessel which contains the water utilized by priests to wash their fingers after distributing Communion. At the end of the Holy Mass, the sacristan, Sister Julia Dubowska, takes the vasculum with the Host and for increased safety pours it into another vessel which she then locks in the safe where the chalices were kept. At the beginning of January of 2009 the Curia of Białystok asked two eminent specialists in pathologoical anatomy of the Medical University of Białystok - Professor Maria Elżbieta Sobaniec-Łotowska and Professor Stanisław Sulkowski, to analyze the samples of the bloodstained Host. On Janaury 7 - Professor Sobaniec-Łotowska went to Sokółka and took from the corporal a minuscule sample of the mysterious substance present in the Host. “At first I was convinced that it was a blood clot” - said Professor Sobaniec-Łotowska. But the truth was much more surprising! The two scientists of Białystok, who for their own independent investigations, made use of the most modern optical microscopes and the transmission electronic microscope, have reached the same conclusion (Professor Sulkowski, did not know that the sample which he was examining came from a Host): the sample examined was neither a clot, nor blood ... it was a human cardiac muscle tissue still alive. And, something even more incredible, it was a cardiac muscle with typical indications of the final phase that precedes death.",
      "text": "A week later, on Sunday, October 19, around 8:00 AM, the sister opens the safe and finds the Host almost dissolved but with some strange red clots in the center. She immediately calls the priests to show them what was discovered. The Host was mostly dissolved. Only a very small piece of the consecrated bread was left, tightly interconnected to the substance that appeared on its surface. Actually, part of the Host was joined to that “strange red clot”. The pastor of Sokółka then contacted the Metropolitan Curia of Białystok. Archbishop Edward Ozorowski together with the Chancellor of the Curia, priests and professors examined the Host and, astounded, decide to wait for the development of the events and to see what would happen next. On October 29 the vessel containing the Host is brought into the parish chapel and locked in the tabernacle; the next day, on order of the Archbishop, Father Gniedziejko delicately removes with a small spoon the partially dissolved Host with the blood colored substance on its interior and places it on a pure white corporal, with a red cross embroidered on its center. The corporal is kept in the case used for keeping and carrying the Hosts, to be then locked again in the tabernacle. Over time the Host “fused” with the corporal and the red “clot” dried. Only then two scientists of global fame and specialists in pathological anatomy at the Medical University of Białystok were consulted. The Metropolitan Curia of Białystok has released this declaration concerning the Eucharistic Miracle that occurred at Sokółka: “1- On October 12, 2008, a consecrated Host fell out of the hands of a priest while he was distributing Holy Communion. He picked it up and placed it in a vessel filled with water, in the tabernacle. After Mass, the vessel containing the host was placed in a safe present in the sacristy. 2- On October 19, 2008, after opening the safe one could clearly see a red stain on the Host that had fallen, which with the naked eye immediately gave the impression of being a bloodstain. 3- On October 29, 2008, the vessel containing the Host was transferred to the tabernacle of the chapel of the rectory. The next day the Host was removed from the water contained in the vessel and placed on a corporal inside the tabernacle. 4- On January 7, 2009, the sample of the Host was taken and examined independently by two professionals in histopathology at the University of Medicine of Białystok. They issued a common declaration which states: ‘The sample sent for evaluation looks like myocardial tissue. In our opinion, of all the tissues of living organisms this is the one that resembles it the most.’ 5- The Commission has noted that the analyzed Host is the same one that has been moved from the sacristy to the tabernacle in the chapel of the rectory. Intervention by a third party has not been found. 6- The case of Sokółka does not contradict the faith of the Church, but rather confirms it.” he professors of the UMB University had underlined that, in the case of the examined Host, in the sample they have found numerous biomorphological indicators typical of cardiac muscle tissue such as, for example, the phenomenon of segmentation, namely damage to the fibers of the tissue of the cardiac muscle in the section where communicating junctions [structures characteristic of the cardiac muscle] are found, and the phenomenon of fragmentation. Such damages are visible in the form of numerous small lesions. These alterations can be observed only in fibers that were not necrotic, that is alive, and show signs of the fast spasms of the cardiac muscle typical of the extreme phase preceding death. Another important evidence of the fact that the material analyzed corresponded to human cardiac muscle tissue was the central position of the cellular nucleus in the observed fibers, a typical characteristic of cardiac muscle fibers... The two scientists of Białystok declared… “Some signs that can correspond to nodes of the contractions have been observed on the section of several fibers. Instead, during the analysis with the electronic microscope, the outlines of the communicating junctions and the thin filaments of the myofibrils were visible”. Moreover, the cardiac tissue was joined to the consecrated Host in an inseparable manner. In the report of the examination performed by Professor Sobaniec-Łotowska and Professor Sulkowski, we find written: “The material resulted was sufficient for the examination; it indicates that it is cardiac muscle tissue, or at least the most similar to it among all the living tissues of an organism”. “And, something very important, the material analyzed is composed in all respects of cardiac muscular tissue”. This affirmation is reported in the “Communication of the Metropolitan Curia of Białystok” of October 14, 2009, concerning the Eucharistic phenomena at Sokółka. The professors discovered also other unexplainable elements. “The Host remained in water for a long time and it remained in the corporal for an even longer period of time. The tissue that appeared on the Host would therefore have had to undergo the process of autolysis, namely the process of self-destruction by the action of the intracellular enzymes; in the material analyzed there were not however observed traces of these alterations!”, the two luminaries declared. Another very interesting event observed consists in that the substance found on the corporal, although slightly changed after being removed from the water (it had simply dried) a couple of years ago, it did not change its appearance despite having been neither stabilized nor preserved at a particular temperature. “This signifies that if the miracle were due to a bacterium, the material would have disintegrated, crumbled and would have changed appearance. Any microbial culture, even placed on the cleanest possible material, after a single week appears completely different” added Professor Sulkowski. nd yet, several people, who not only have never analyzed the material but they had neither seen it with their own eyes, have affirmed that the red color of the Host is due to prodigiosin, a red pigment produced by the bacterium Serratia marcescens. “Obviously, this is absurd” affirmed the specialists of Białystok, also because the material observed corresponds to cardiac muscle and not to a bacterium. The scientists of Białystok have analyzed the sample taken in purely scientific terms and not fideistic. Several accusations were even more absurd, like the one put forth by the group of so-called “rationalists” according to whom the tissue analyzed pertained to a murdered man. The professors reacted with a statement in which they expressed “a profound indignation for the fact that the public opinion was led in error by false pseudoscientific hypotheses on the analyzed phenomenon, above all on the part of people who ignore the particulars relative to the analysis, who have neither access to the material analyzed, nor to the documentation collected, and who often do not even know the analytical techniques applied”. The drafting of the protocol on the part of the two scientists of Białystok required two weeks. When the Curia of Białystok became aware of the incredible results of the analyses, it formed a special Ecclesiastical Commission convened by the Archbishop on March 30, 2009. His task consisted in examining the miracle from the theological point of view and in listening to all who had seen the Host or who had been witnesses of those extraordinary events. The commission also had the task of dispelling any doubt of deception and of ascertaining that no one had furtively substituted the Host in the tabernacle, The representatives of the commission - the distinguished professors of the Seminary of Białystok - interrogated all the witnesses, verifying the sincerity of their testimonies. The work undertaken by the Ecclesiastical Commission has produced the following statement: “The Host from which the sample was taken for the examination is the same one that has been transferred from the sacristy to the tabernacle of the chapel in the rectory. The intervention of strangers was not observed”. This was moreover categorically excluded also by the two scientists of Białystok. It was not possible that someone had placed a fragment of a human body in the tabernacle. What made one think so? The fragments which composed the Host were tightly interconnected to the fibers of the human tissue; they penetrated each other, as if a fragment of “bread” had suddenly transformed itself in “body”. It is not possible to manipulate an event of this type. No one, absolutely no one, would have been able to do it. “Even the scientists of NASA, who have at their disposal the most modern analytical techniques, would not be able to artificially recreate such a thing”, affirmed Professor Sobaniec-Łotowska, adding that this fact has been for her of particular importance.",

Still today, in the Church of St. Stephen of Santarém, it is possible to admire these precious relics. According to the date recorded in the document commissioned by King Alfonso IV in 1346, on February 16, 1266 in Santarém, a young woman overcome with jealousy for her husband, consulted a sorceress who told her to go to the church and steal a consecrated Host to use for a love potion. The woman stole the Host and hid the Holy Eucharist in a linen cloth that immediately became stained with Blood. Frightened by this, she ran home and opened the kerchief to see what had happened. To her amazement, she saw that the Blood was gushing from the Host. The confused woman stored the Particle in a drawer in her bedroom. That night the drawer began to emit brilliant rays of light which illuminated the room as if it were daytime. The husband was also aware of the strange phenomenon and questioned his wife, who was obligated to tell him everything. The next day, the couple informed the pastor, who went to the home to remove the Host and return the Blessed Sacrament to the Church of St. Stephen in solemn procession, accompanied by many religious and lay people. The Host bled for three consecutive days, and was then placed in a beautiful reliquary made of beeswax. In 1340 another miracle occurred. When the priest opened the tabernacle, he found the beeswax vase broken into many pieces: in its place was a crystal vase containing the Blood mixed with the wax. The Sacred Host is now preserved in an 18th century Eucharistic throne above the main altar. The Church of St. Stephen is now known as the Shrine of the Holy Miracle. Throughout the centuries, on various occasions the Host gave new emissions of Blood, and in some cases various images of Our Lord were seen in the Holy Eucharist. Among the witnesses of this prodigy is St. Francis Xavier, the apostle of the Indies, who visited the shrine before going on the missions. Every year since the miracle occurred, on the second Sunday of April, the precious relic is processed from the home of the couple to the Church of St. Stephen. The couple’s home became a chapel in the year 1684.",

A priest, carrying a ciborium containing the Viaticum (Eucharist) destined for some sick people, was crossing a river on mule-back when he was suddenly swept off his mount by a rushing wave. The priest tumbled into the water along with his ciborium, which was emptied of its precious content. The Hosts fell out and were being carried away by the current toward the mouth of the river nearby. The priest, barely saving himself, full of remorse, and lamenting what had occurred as he tried to free himself from the mud and the waters, was approached by some fishermen who were stunned to have witnessed, in the place where the river water flowed into the sea, three fish, each with a little white disc resembling Communion Hosts, in its mouth. The priest immediately ran to the church and returned to the river bank with another ciborium. He did everything in such a hurry that he didn’t even stop to ask himself if the fishermen’s story was believable. Great was his joy when he saw that the three remarkable fish were there, almost completely out of the water, lifting the Hosts intact with their mouths, like little trophies. He fell to his knees, and extending his chalice, prayed as he had never prayed before in his entire life; and thus, he saw the fish deposit the Hosts in the chalice, one after the other, and then dive and slither rapidly back into the water to disappear into the sea. Only at that moment did the priest notice that he was surrounded by a group of men and women who had witnessed the entire scene. Today it is still possible to consult numerous documents testifying to the miracle.

      "text": "In 1597, a penitent bandit brought himself to confession at the Jesuit church of Alcalá. He was said to have been part of a band of Moorish gypsies who, after being dispersed from the nearby mountains, had sacked numerous churches and stole monstrances and other sacred objects in different countries, committing many sacrilegious acts. The penitent brought with him some consecrated Hosts that he delivered to the confessor with many tears. The confessor, very moved, went immediately to his superior to inform him. Initially it was agreed to consume the Hosts during a Mass, but later, fearing that the Hosts could be poisoned as had recently been done to some priests in Murcia and Segovia, it was decided to keep the Hosts in a box made of silver and to allow them to decompose naturally. Eleven years later the twenty-four Hosts were found still intact. The mystic Father Luis de la Palma, in his capacity as Provincial, ordered that the Hosts be placed in a wine cellar along with some unconsecrated hosts. A few months later, the unconsecrated hosts had decomposed from the humidity, while the consecrated Hosts remained intact. Six years later Father Palma decided to make public the miracle of the Hosts that were still intact. New academic and medical tests from the doctor of His Majesty, Garcia Carrera, as well as numerous illustrious theologians, all of whom identified this as a true miracle. In 1619 ecclesiastical authorities officially authorized the veracity of the Miracle. The Holy Hosts were publicly adored before King Phillip III, who in 1620 presided over a solemn procession in which the whole royal family participated. When Charles III expelled the Jesuits from Spain, the Sacred Hosts were moved to the magisterial church. In 1936, when the communist revolutionists burned the church, the priests carefully hid the miraculous Hosts prior to being murdered. However, still today the hiding place of the Hosts has not been found. There have been many surveys in the church and in the crypt, but to no avail. Nobody until today had published any news of the twenty-four Sacred Hosts. “God has made a new miracle!” exclaimed the wise biographer of the city, Don Anselmo Raymundo Tornero, who has transmitted this story to us meticulously in his work.",

Juan Prats consumed the three Hosts immediately and then hid the box in his stable underneath a pile of wood. The next day, the parish priest, Don Antonio, found out about the sacrilegious theft. Distressed, he sounded the church bells to let the people know of the horrendous act. Soon after, all of the people of Alcoy were assembled in prayer in front of the church. The searches began immediately, but were in vain. Near Juan Prat’s house lived a pious widow, María Miralles, who had a statue of the Holy Child. The woman, profoundly disturbed by the profane act, began to pray intensely in front of the statue of Jesus, pleading for the consecrated Hosts to be returned to the citizens of Alcoy. Few hours had passed when she started her fervent prayer when María saw the little hand of the statue of Jesus point its finger to the house of her neighbor, Juan Prats. The woman, suspicious, decided to tell the civil authorities of what had taken place. In that moment the pastor of the church, moved by a mysterious force, went to the garden of the house of Juan Prats and entered the stable. He rummaged through the pile of wood and immediately recovered the silver box with the three consecrated Hosts. Juan Prats, not understanding how the three Hosts were inside the silver box again, (as he remembered consuming them) repented deeply and confessed the misdeed. The documents relative to the miracle and the statue of Baby Jesus are still kept today in the monastery of the Holy Sepulcher of Alcoy.",

We know with certainty that a Christian priest, Don Gínes Pérez Chirinos de Cuenca, traveled amongst the Moors of the Kingdom of Murcia with the purpose of preaching the Gospel. He was captured, however, and brought to the presence of the Moorish King Zeyt-Abu-Zeyt who asked him some questions about certain aspects of the Christian faith. The king particularly wanted to deepen his understanding of the Mass. The priest went into detail explaining the importance of the Mass and the king, fascinated by the preaching of the priest, ordered him immediately to celebrate a Mass. Since the priest did not have the necessary equipment for the celebration, the king ordered some of his men to get them from the nearby country of Cuenca, in Christian territory. But still, the Cross, which needed to be present on the altar during a Mass, had been forgotten. The priest began to celebrate the Mass but, at a certain point, realized the absence of the Cross. He became troubled and stopped. The king asked him why he was so disturbed and the priest told him that he needed a Cross. The king however immediately responded, “Wouldn’t that be it?” In fact, at that moment two angels were placing a Cross upon the altar. The priest was deeply moved and gave thanks to the Lord. He then continued with the glorious celebration. The miracle continued. At the moment of the consecration, the Muslim king saw a beautiful Baby in the place of the Host Who gazed on him endearingly. After having witnessed the miraculous event, the king and his family converted to Christianity and were baptized. Zeyt-Abu-Zeyt took the name of Vincent and his wife took the name Elena. From that day, the 3rd of March 1231, the country is called Caravaca de la Cruz. Recently, in the jubilee year, the Holy See allowed Caravaca de la Cruz to be the fifth city in the world, after Santiago de Compostela, Santo Toribio de Liebana, Rome and Jerusalem, to celebrate the Perpetual Jubilee (one holy year every seven in perpetuum) in the Sanctuary where the Holy Cross is kept.",

Before the first battle, the chaplain, Don Mateo Martínez of Daroca, celebrated the Holy Mass, during which he consecrated six Hosts designated for Communion for the six captains who led the troops: Don Jiménez Pérez, Don Fernando Sánchez, Don Pedro, Don Raimundo, Don Guillermo and Don Simone Carroz. An improvised attack of the enemy obliged the chaplain to immediately suspend the Mass, and coil the six consecrated Hosts in the corporal and to hide them under a rock. The enemy troops had been forced back and the commanders begged the priest to permit them to receive Holy Communion in thanksgiving for the obtained victory. Don Mateo brought them to the place where he had hidden the corporal and they found the Hosts drenched in Blood. The commanders interpreted this event as a great sign of predilection on the part of God and of good auspices. They received Communion and tied the Blood-stained corporal to a spear to make a banner. In this way, they brought the banner into battle against the castle walls and reconquered the Castle of Chio, obtaining a miraculous victory. This triumph was attributed to the Eucharistic miracle. The six commanders went to all the different regions of Spain and each of them began to maintain that the corporal must go into his own city. This began an open discussion. Three times, the city of Daroca was chosen to be the custodial place of the miracle. They arrived at a compromise. They decided to place the corporal on the back of a mule to be left to freely wander about. The city where the mule would stop would be the place chosen by the Divine Will to be custodian of the corporal. The mule traveled for 12 days, walking about 200 miles, until exhausted. It collapsed in front of the Church of Saint Mark in Daroca. Afterwards, a church dedicated to Our Lady was constructed along with a precious reliquary where, even today, it is possible to venerate the Bloodstained corporal.",

A nun that followed the rite from above the altar saw the priest remove something from his mouth, and afterwards wrapped it in the corporal and placed it on the corner of the altar. After the Mass, the nun went immediately to the altar to verify what the priest had hidden in the white cloth and with great amazement discovered that it contained a small piece of Flesh, dripping with Blood. Questioned, the priest confessed to doubting the Real Presence of Jesus in the Eucharist. And just as he put the Holy Host in his mouth, the size increased to such a volume and consistency that he was not able to swallow the Sacred Species. This is why he had wrapped the Eucharist in one of the corporals and left the Sacrament on the altar. The little Particle which was changed into Flesh was then placed in a reliquary.

One of the profaners, penitent and upset by the sight, warned the Canon Jean van der Delft, who succeeded in making the Hosts safe.

Above the altar where the miraculous Hosts are preserved, the Italian artist, Filippo Filippini made four bas-reliefs in marble and bronze that represent the phenomenal events.

He could not see any more. Then the priest began to implore the Lord to remove his doubts. Slowly the cloud began to reduce itself and presented this sight: the Host was lifted above the chalice and abundant drops of Blood began to fall that immediately replenished the chalice and even overflowed pouring onto the corporal and on the pall. At that point, the priest heard a voice that said: \"Finish the Holy Mass, and for the moment reveal to no one what you saw\".

Therefore, they retreated to Avignon where Clement VII continued to act as the legitimate pontiff. During this period of great uncertainties, Fr. Mosén Jaime Carrós, a priest in Moncada, was living in the anguish that his ordination was invalid, since a bishop appointed by the antipope Clement VII had ordained him. Every time he celebrated Mass he greatly feared he was deceiving the faithful by distributing unconsecrated hosts. He was also terrified that none of the other sacraments he was performing were valid. The priest ardently prayed for the Lord to give him some sign of confirmation. He received an answer on Christmas Day, 1392. That day, the aristocratic woman Angela Alpicat attended Mass with her five year old daughter, Inés (the future St. Inés de Moncada). At the end of Mass, the little girl refused to leave the church, imploring her mother to let her remain there to play with the beautiful child the pastor had held in his arms during Mass. On December 26, Lady Angela went to Mass again, and when the priest lifted the Host, the little girl saw the child in the hands of the priest. At the end of Mass, Lady Angela referred her daughter’s visions to the priest, who immediately examined her. Little Inés answered all the priest’s questions without any difficulties. The priest, though, wanted to test her further and invited her to attend Mass on the following day. At that time, he took two hosts, but he consecrated only one of them. Then, taking the consecrated Host, the priest asked the little girl what she could see in his hands. She answered, “I see Baby Jesus.” Then he lifted the unconsecrated host and asked the same question. “I see a white little disc,” Inés answered. The priest was overwhelmed with joy, and the whole congregation exulted in seeing the validity of their pastor’s ordination confirmed.

A farmer from Barxamaior by the name of Juan Santín, left the convent to attend Mass.

He began in this way to celebrate the Mass, and immediately after having professed the words of the consecration, the Host changed to Flesh and the wine changed to Blood, and was expelled from the chalice and stained the corporal. At that very moment, it seemed that even the head of the wooden statue of the Madonna was leaning in adoration. The people today call her the “Madonna of the Sacred Miracle”. The Lord had wanted to open the eyes of the incredulous priest who had doubted and to compensate the farmer for his great devotion.

Nicolás Bernabeu was arrested, but did not want to reveal where he hid the pyx, which still contained the Blessed Sacrament. The faithful and the civil authorities looked for days all over the countryside but the stolen goods were in the nearby town of Tibi where the thief lived.

      "text": "Juan De Benavente lived in Ponferrada with his wife. It was apparent that he was very devout and religious. In fact every evening he stopped in church to pray. One day, during his prayer time, he succumbed to greed and seized the tabernacle, a simple wooden container, in which there was a precious silver ciborium containing some consecrated Hosts. He fled from the church and headed towards the Sil River in order to pitch the cheap wooden tabernacle, but when he tried to launch it into the water he could not because of its sudden immense weight. So he returned home where he hid everything and said nothing to his wife. During the night continuous flashes of light came from the tabernacle, arousing the suspicion of his wife. So Juan decided to go out and dispose of his sacrilegious stolen goods. He reached a place the townspeople called the Arenal Field and threw the tabernacle and consecrated Hosts into the middle of the blackberry patch. The discovery of the crime brought dismay among all of the population and Juan became increasingly nervous and anxious, also because he did not know how to sell the silver ciborium without getting caught. Near the Arenal Field , the owner of the land, Diego Nuñez de Losada, set up a target practice for entertainment during the feast days. During the time frame in which the sacred Hosts were still in the blackberry patch, eyewitnesses reported seeing flashes of light at night and strange doves hovering during the day. The crossbowmen tried in vain to hit the doves. The miller Nogaledo decided then to capture the doves with his own hands and ventured into the blackberry patch, discovering the tabernacle and the sacred Hosts from where the intense flashes of light originated. Disturbed, he went straight towards the church where the bells were ringing in the distance. The return of the sacred Hosts was organized vith a solemn procession. Juan was overcome with remorse and decided to admit his guilt. In the place where the miraculous Hosts were recovered a chapel was immediately constructed. In 1570 the parish priest planned the expansion of the building and instituted a solemn annual procession on the eighth day of the Feast of Corpus Christi in memory of the miracle.",

In 1251 someone put a consecrated Host there, but the memory of this was lost in time. Only in 1426, while working to restore the statues, the cavity in the forehead of the crucifix was discovered, sealed by a small silver plaque.

The Sacred Species were found two days later in a small garden outside the city, hidden under a stone. The pastor returned them with a solemn procession to the church. In 1934, realizing that the Hosts remained “in the same way in which they were found under the stone and that they had remained unchanged in the original condition”, the Archbishop of Valencia started a process to declare their preservation a miracle, and sealed with wax the reliquary containing the Hosts. He also wrote a detailed documentation of the miracle. Unfortunately, two years later the bishop’s residence was burned down by the anarchists-communists and the precious document was lost. In 1982, then-Archbishop of Valencia. Monsignor Miguel Roca, started a new canonical process by which he also determined how to officially worship the Sacred Host of the miracle.",

There are a number of variants to indicate the Grail: San Greal, Holy Grail, Sangreal in England, Sanct Graal and Saint Graal in the antique and modern French, Gral and Graal in German. The “grolla” of the Aostan valley is lexically related to the grail and similar to the Latin gradalis o gratalis, “vase” or glass. From many sources, we know that a few centuries after the death of Christ the Holy Grail was being shown to Christian pilgrims in Jerusalem. According to the account of Arculo, a French bishop who lived in the Holy Land in 720 A.D, the Chalice in which the Lord Himself consecrated His own Blood was preserved in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem. The venerable Bede adds that the cup was protected by a net and it could be touched and kissed through an opening. No one knows exactly when the Chalice was taken from Jerusalem; most probably as far back as the seventh century. Today, in the gothic chapel of the “Santo Caliz” (“Holy Chalice”) in the city’s cathedral, a miraculous chalice identified by tradition as the Holy Grail, is kept and shown for the veneration of the faithful. This precious item is constructed in different portions: the inverted upper part of a Cornelian chalice constitutes the base, the stem is enriched by precious stones and the upper part is a cup, also of Cornelian. These parts are attributed to different eras; the cup is the most antique and the most difficult to date and constitutes the most interesting part. On the base there is an inscription in Arabic of disputed interpretation, but that could be another proof to determine the date. According to professor Salvador Antunano, “When we know the mystery of the Chalice of the Holy Grail we realize that in it there is nothing enigmatic or esoteric. The history of this precious Chalice concerns the most dramatic, most sublime episode ever lived by humanity: the history of the Word made Man and Eucharist”.",

To change the husband’s behavior, the sorcerer told her he needed a consecrated Host. The very superstitious woman went to the church of Saint Michael, went to confession and received the Eucharist. With diabolical cunning, she took the Blessed Sacrament from her mouth and hid the Host in a small coffer which she took immediately to the sorcerer. When they opened the coffer, instead of the Host they saw, with great terror, a little Baby surrounded by light. The sorcerer told the woman to take the coffer home, burn the Holy Eucharist, and bring the ashes to him. The unscrupulous woman did as she was told, but with great amazement saw that though the coffer was completely burned, the Baby remained unharmed. “Stricken with terror and out of her mind she ran to the house of the sorcerer to tell him what happened. The sorcerer on hearing the words of the woman, began to tremble, fearing a vengeance from heaven. They decided to go to the cathedral to inform the bishop don Alonso, confess their sin and ask for baptism. “The bishop consulted some prelates and theologians of the diocese to shed light on the event and finally decided to take the Miraculous Baby in solemn procession from the house of the woman to the cathedral. The whole city accompanied the procession and was deeply moved at the sight of the marvelous Baby. Once in the cathedral, the Miraculous Baby was put on the altar of the chapel of Saint Valerio so that the people of Zaragoza could see Him and venerate Him. The following day while the bishop was celebrating Mass at the same altar, at the words of consecration, a Host, immediately consumed by the bishop, appeared where the Baby was. Thanks to this Eucharistic miracle, the people of Zaragoza were renewed in their devotion to the Blessed Sacrament.” This is the document preserved in the town archives.",

Many Popes granted indulgences to the shrine's visitors. The great feast of the miracle’s chapel takes place on “Laetare” Sunday and on the two following days.",
      "text": "The most important document that describes the miracle is the “Protocol of Justice”. This was compiled on July 16, 1447 by Hermann von Russeg, Lord of Buron. Its translation reads: “On Wednesday, May 23, 1447, the Blessed Sacrament was stolen from the parish Church of Ettiswil, and soon after it was found by Margaret Schulmeister, a young lady who had a swineherd. The Holy Eucharist was not far from the parish church, close to the fence and thrown on the ground among nettles, and looked like a bright flower.” After close investigation, the police arrested a young lady, Anna Vögtli from Bischoffingen, who soon of her own accord, confessed everything: “Having slipped my hand in the narrow iron gate, I got hold of the large Host. But as soon as I went beyond the cemetery wall, the Host became so heavy that I was unable to carry the Sacred Host any longer. Being unable to go forward or to go backward, I threw away the Host, close to a fence in the nettles”. The Sacred Host was discovered by Fraulein Margaret Schulmeister, a swineherd. She stated that “Once I arrived with my pigs close to the place where the Blessed Sacrament had been thrown, my animals did not want to go further. I asked the help of two men who were passing by on their horses. The two men saw in the grass the stolen Host divided in seven Sections. Six of the Sections formed a flower similar to a rose and a great light was surrounding Them.” The local parish priest was informed. He at once, together with all the parishioners, went there to pick up the Host and to bring the Sacred Host back to the church. He picked up the six Sections, but when he wanted to pick up the main central Section, this stuck to the ground before everybody’s eyes. This partition was interpreted as a sign, and it was decided to build a chapel precisely at that place where the Host had disappeared. The six Sections were kept in the church of Ettiswil and became a Sacred Object of great veneration by the inhabitants of the village and of foreigners. God performed many miracles there. The chapel and the altar were consecrated on December 28, 1448: a year and half after the events.",

Father Otty, Chaplain of the Shrine, thus describes the event: “After having consumed one of the pieces of the large Host which I had divided into 4 parts, I returned them to the paten. A little later I looked down towards the paten and I could not believe what I saw: one of the pieces of the Host that I divided was showing a red spot and from It a red substance began to emanate, similar to the manner in which blood escapes from a wound. After Mass, I took the Host and preserved It safely in the sacristy of the Shrine. The next day, at 6 in the morning, I went to see the Host and verified that some blood continued to flow that a little later began to dry. However, still today, the blood appears as fresh. The strange thing is that the blood flowed only from one side of the Particle, nevertheless, without staining the remainder of the Eucharistic species”. During the Mass there were numerous pilgrims who immediately verified that the priest did not have wounds from which the blood present in the Host could have flowed. Besides, from the analyses, the result concluded that the blood of the priest did not match the one of the Particle. The Host of the Miracle was subjected to some special studies, requested by the then Bishop of Los Teques, H. E. Most Reverend Pio Bello Ricardo, and the results confirmed that the blood was human blood of type AB positive which matches the one found in the cloth of the Shroud of Turin and in the Host of the Eucharistic Miracle of Lanciano, that occurred in Italy in 750 AD and was analyzed by 500 commissions of the World Health Organization. Since then the Host has been an object of veneration and of devotion on the part of thousands of pilgrims coming not only from Venezuela but from the whole world. It is possible to go to the convent of the Augustinian Recollects Nuns of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Los Teques to see the miraculous Host all the days of the year at any hour in their chapel devoted to Perpetual Adoration. A young faithful from New Jersey, Daniel J. Sanford, having gone on a pilgrimage to the Convent of the Augustinians to see the bleeding Host, was able to film another miraculous episode. Here is the story: “On the 12th of November of 1998 I went on pilgrimage to Betania with a prayer group and they took us to see the miraculous Host of Betania in the Chapel of the Augustinian Sisters of Los Teques. Our spiritual director, Father Mazzarella, celebrated the Mass. After the celebration ended he opened the door of the Tabernacle which contained the Host of the Miracle. With great astonishment I saw that the Host was as if in flames, and there was a Pulsating Heart that was bleeding in Its center. I saw this for about 30 seconds or so, then the Host returned to normal. I was able to film a part of this miracle with my video camera...”.",

Before St. Thomas started his dissertation, he went in church to pray and then finally wrote the actual text. Once the exhibit was concluded, St. Thomas returned to church and that is when Our Lord Jesus appeared to him to confirm the righteousness of his writings.",
      "text": "During his second tenure as professor in Paris, St. Thomas found himself in the middle of a dispute taking place among the professors at the Sorbonne University in regard to the Eucharistic sacrament. The dispute was about two points: a) if the senses perceive the presence of the so-called “accident”, such as color, taste, durability and quantity, it would be the concrete extension of the true and real Eucharistic Bread and Wine; b) faith confirms that in the sacrament exists the Body and Blood of Christ, which is an apparent contrast with the former theory. Parisian theologians were clearly divided between the objective theory and the value of faith. They decided to ask St. Thomas because they already had the opportunity of experiencing his philosophical intelligence and his theological sanctity. They asked him to offer and communicate his opinion, in that his theological wisdom would become the rule to follow. Thomas then, as he usually did, retreated himself to prayer and contemplation and started to pray with great fervor and devotion. Soon after, he quickly jotted down in writing the least amount of words with the most precise clarity possible, what his mind was able to understand and what The Lord inspired him to write. He returned in church, went to the altar and laid down his written answers under the eye of the Crucifix and prayed: “Our Lord Jesus, actually and forever present in this Blessed Sacrament, I am asking You to help me understand Your truth and to be able to teach and confer it without any possibility of errors. So, I beseech thee, Oh Lord, to concede me this grace: If the things that I wrote about You and with Your blessing are true, make it possible for me to say and teach them publicly. If, instead, I have written something that is not in tune to the truth revealed and alien to the mystery of the sacrament, stop me from inferring anything that could deviate from the Catholic faith.” This was the humble prayer of the theologian who understands that he is dealing with things much higher than himself and that he has a grave responsibility towards his people. Father Reginaldo, his secretary, and other brethren were fortunate enough to observe St. Thomas while in deep prayer, when suddenly Christ appeared and motioned towards his writings and said: “You wrote well about the sacrament of my Body and you wrote well and according to truth; you also have resolved the question that was posed to you. This understanding of the Truth defines and holds true, as long as man is present on earth.” Having heard this, Thomas was filled with joy and thanksgiving, and prostrated himself and knelt down at the altar in front of our Lord.",

Upon his departure, it was entrusted to a noble matron, Lady Jacopa of the Sette Soli (Seven Suns), so that she would have custody of it in her home. And the lamb, as if spiritually educated by the saint in matters of the soul, would not leave the woman’s side when she went to church, when she stayed, or returned. Some mornings, when the lady was late in awakening, the lamb would gently pounce and nudge her with his little horns, and woke her with his bleats, encouraging her with his gestures and expressions to hurry to church. For this, the lady had much admiration and love for that lamb, disciple of Francis and teacher of devotion. [...] One day while walking in the outskirts of Siena, Saint Francis encountered a huge herd of sheep at pasture. As he always did, he kindly saluted them, and they, having stopped grazing, all ran towards him, raising their heads and meeting his gaze. They greeted him with such festivity that the shepherds were stupefied, seeing the lambs and the rams jumping around in such a wondrous way. [...] Another time, at Santa Maria della Porziuncola, some people brought as a gift to this man of God, a sheep, and he accepted it with gratitude, because he loved the innocence and the simplicity that the sheep demonstrated by nature. The man of God admonished the little lamb to praise God and to absolutely not bother the brothers. The sheep, for his part, sensed the piety of this man of God, and he put these teachings into practice with great care. When he heard the brothers singing in the choir, he would enter the church, bend his knees, and emit tender harmonious bleats in front of the altar of the Virgin Mother of the Lamb, as if with a strong desire to greet her.

After the consecration, Bernard placed the Host on the paten and exited the church, with his face aflame with sacred ire. “When he arrived in front of the duke, he admonished him with these words: ‘We prayed for you and you ridiculed us. Here now, He, the Son of the Virgin, the Lord of the Church, He Whom you persecute, has come to you. Here, you have before you that Judge whose hands one day will hold your soul. Perhaps you will reject Him as you have rejected His servant? Resist Him if you can.’ The duke immediately felt his legs fold underneath him and prostrated himself at the feet of Bernard, who then ordered him to stand on his feet to hear the penitential sentence of God. The duke trembled as he stood and he followed all that Bernard ordered him to do.”",

Everyone noticed and wondered what Don Bosco would do. Giuseppe Buzzetti, who became one of the first Salesian priests, was serving Mass that day when he saw Don Bosco multiply the Hosts and give Holy Communion to the 360 people. Don Bosco tells the story of what he saw in a dream: a terrible battle at sea caused by a multitude of boats, both large and small, fighting against a sole majestic ship, a symbol of the Church. Hit many times but always victorious, the ship was guided by the Pope to anchor itself securely between two tall pillars in the sea. The first held up high a huge Host with the writing, “Salvation of the Faithful” and the other which was lower, held a statue of Immaculate Mary, with the writing, “Help of Christians”.",

The poor girl found herself so completely isolated in that basement that the rats were often her only companions. Germaine, however, was very close and devoted to the Lord and in particular loved the Blessed Sacrament and prayed and visited on a daily basis. Every day she would leave her sheep unattended to receive the Holy Eucharist and miraculously the herd would never be attacked by wolves. To reach the church, however, Germaine had to cross the stream called Courbet. One day the heavy rains had rendered the stream impossible to pass through, but the young girl decided to affront the furious waters of the stream and get through so she could receive Communion. Before going into the water in order to get across, she made the sign of the Cross and while she was reciting her prayers she saw the waters miraculously separate in two.

The notoriety of Saint Egidio was well established even before performing this miracle. Originally from Athens, he had retreated to a hermitage in a forest of Gard, where a fawn visited him daily to nourish him with her own milk. One day while hunting, the King of the Visigoths followed the animal to the threshold of the grotto where the hermit lived and shot the fawn. In order to correct the sacrilege he had committed, the king had a great monastery built which would take the name of St. Gilles-du-Gard, and which would become an important stop along the path of the pilgrims going to Compostela, before itself becoming a place of pilgrimage.

      "text": "Saint Stanislaus Kostka was born in 1550 in Rostkow, a few kilometers from Warsaw. In 1564, at age fourteen, Stanislaus was sent to Vienna with his older brother to complete their studies with the Jesuits. He liked his studies and life in the college very much, and considered dedicating himself to religious life. Unfortunately the Jesuits had to close the college and Stanislaus, his brother, and their tutor were forced to leave, accepting the hospitality of a Lutheran nobleman. Stanislaus maintained exemplary religious behavior, regardless of the pressures from his brother, tutor, and host - who all criticized him. This was all accepted with patience and submission by Stanislaus, and during the night he even prayed for them. At about age seventeen, Stanislaus became gravely ill. It is necessary to note that he belonged to the Fraternity of Saint Barbara - whose members trust their patroness to bring them Communion upon the point of death. In this Stanislaus had total faith, and in fact one night woke up his tutor, who was keeping his vigil, exclaiming: “Here is Saint Barbara! Here she is, with two angels! She’s bringing me the Blessed Sacrament!” And so it was, the angels knelt by him and he was given Holy Communion. The young man, serene, laid back on his bed. A few days later, to everyone’s surprise, Stanislaus awoke perfectly healed, declaring that he wanted to go personally to thank the Lord and manifest his desire to become a religious. The regional father of the Jesuits rejected him because of his young age and because he had no father or legal guardian, but Stanislaus did not lose his faith and decided to immediately try Germany or even Italy. He removed his fine clothes, put on those of a farmer, and walked towards Augusta where the great Saint Peter Canisius resided, provinicial of the Jesuits in Germany. Noticing his absence, his brother searched for him and began to feel remorse for his hostile conduct. Meanwhile, Saint Peter Canisius seriously evaluated the vocation of the young man and decided to send him to the Jesuit seminary in Rome. In his letter of recommendation of Stanislaus, he wrote: “Stanislaus, noble Pole, a just man full of zeal, admitted for a certain time to the college of Dillingen, showed himself to always be exact in his duty and firm in his vocation… we hope and expect great things from him.”",

These rays represent the Water and Blood that came out of Jesus’ pierced side while on the Cross. This symbolizes the purifying virtues of Baptism and Confession and the regenerative virtue of the Holy Eucharist.",

I promise that the souls of those who attribute veneration to this image will not perish. I even promise victory over their enemies, already here on earth, but especially at the hour of death. I will defend that soul in the name of glory.” Jesus, Himself explained the significance of this devotion: “My daughter, tell all that I am love and mercy personified. The wound in my Heart signifies the unlimited living waters of Mercy. Tell all the souls that I protect them with my shield of Mercy; it is for them that I fight, bearing the just umbrage of my Father […] My daughter! Tell suffering humanity to secure itself to the Mercy of my Heart and I will fill them with peace […] Souls are perishing, regardless of my sorrowful Passion. I concede to them the last table of salvation, meaning my merciful feast […] this icon is a sign of the end days, after such, the day of judgment is upon you.” After showing His Infinite Mercy, the Lord also showed St. Faustina “hell”. “Today, under the guide of an angel, I went into the abyss of hell. It is a place of extreme torments in the entire, huge, terrifying surroundings. These are the various tortures and torments that I have seen: First torture: This consists of hell as being the loss of the Presence of God; Second: the continuous remorseful conscience; Third: the knowledge that such a destiny will never change; Fourth: This torture is a pain that penetrates the soul, but does not nullify it; it is a terrible torture and it is a purely spiritual, living fire lit only by God’s wrath. Fifth: This is the torture of eternal darkness, a horrible suffocating, putrid odor; even if it is dark, the demons and the condemned souls can see each other among themselves and see all the evil that others have done as well as their own evil. Sixth: This torture is the knowledge of having Satan as a constant companion. Seventh and last: This torture is the incomparable desperation of God’s wrath, in blasphemy, cursing and swearing. The sinner should realize the same ways that he sins is the way he is going to suffer for all eternity. I am writing this by the Lord’s direction, so that no one can say that there is no hell, or that no one has ever been there or that no one knows how it is. I, Sister Faustina, under the Lord’s direction, have been in the abyss of hell, for the simple reason of being able to tell everyone and to witness that hell does exist. What I have written is only a weak shadow of what I have actually seen.”",

So he asked for the Eucharist from those whom he knew to be initiated into the Divine Sacrament of the Faithful and placed the Holy Eucharist in a handkerchief, which he hung around his neck. Then he threw himself into the sea and looked for a plank loosened from the hulk of the ship to hang on to, but did not try to swim away to save himself, because he had put his trust only in the weapons of the faith. Since he was convinced that he was sufficiently protected and defended by this faith, he did not look for any other help. “Then, as soon as he was saved from the waves and reached land, he paid tribute to the Leader to whom he had entrusted himself. As soon as he was saved and realized all his servants had been saved, he went to the church of God, without complaining about the goods he had lost, to thank Him for having saved him and to get to know His Eternal Mysteries. He said there was no more important duty than that of giving thanks… He who had experienced the great help of the Heavenly Mysteries wrapped in a handkerchief considered it important to consume the Holy Eucharist and receive the Eucharistic Christ into the depths of his heart.”",

Such is the flame of the Holy Eucharist, because it does not weaken while enflaming the loyal faithful who come with their strong or weak faith. The stronger and weaker charity of each of the faithful is symbolic only by the flame’s dimension of the candles.",
      "text": "Regarding the Eucharist, Jesus confided the following words to St. Catherine of Siena: “You receive all the divine essence of the sweetest Sacrament in the whiteness in the bread. Just like the sun cannot be divided in the whiteness of the Holy Host. Let us suppose that the Sacred Host could be divided: even if it would be possible to fragment the Holy Eucharist into thousands of tiny Particles, in each one of the tiny Particles there is the presence of Christ, the whole God and the whole Man. In the same manner that a mirror would shatter into thousands of pieces, the Sacred Host will not shatter or divide the image of God and Man that you see in the Host; the image of God and Man is in each fragmented part. Contrary to fire, the image of the Host does not diminish in faith or divinity. Let us look at the following example: If you had one candle and the whole world would light its candle from that single candle, the light of the candle would not diminish and everybody would have a lighted candle. While it is true that those who participate in the candlelighting may have more or less flame, everyone would receive exactly the amount of fire to light their candle. Until that time that it can be better, this example stands. “If there were a lot of people bringing candles of all sizes – one person with two candles and one with six candles and one with a candle weighing an ounce and one with a candle weighing a pound or more - then you could see all the lit candles by color. By color, by its light, by its heat, you would judge that the person that has a one-ounce candle has less light than the one with a pound candle. This is how it is for those receiving the Holy Sacrament. Man carries his own candle so that he can receive the sacrament; however, that candle is unlit, but it is ignited when he receives the Eucharist. As a matter of fact, as you are all alike, made and created in my image and likeness and as Christians you are anointed with Holy Baptism, you can, therefore, grow in virtue as much as you like through my divine grace. You are not changing your spiritual life that I bestowed upon you, but you can grow and increase in love of virtue, using your free will with virtue, with charitable affection, while you still have the time, because once time has elapsed, it will no longer be possible.”",

Following the physical sufferings from the paralysis, mystical sufferings were added: for four years, every Friday she saw the sorrows of the Passion, and after this period, for another 13 years until her death she was nourished only by the Eucharist.

At age 14, in order to escape an attack by three men and to maintain her purity, she jumped from the window, but did not escape without suffering injury. The consequences were terrible, if not immediate. In fact, several years later, she became bedridden from a progressively increasing paralysis, from which she suffered for the remaining 30 years of her life. Yet, she did not despair, but entrusted herself to Jesus with these words: “As you are a prisoner in the tabernacle and I am a prisoner on my bed for doing Your will, so we can keep ourselves company\". As a result, she began to live through ever more powerful mystical experiences, and from Friday, October 3, 1938 until March 24, 1942, for up to 182 times, she relived the sufferings of the Passion. Beginning in 1942 until her death, Alexandrina was fed only by the Eucharist, and during a period of convalescence at the Foce del Douro Hospital near Oporto, for forty days and forty nights she was under supervision by several doctors in her absolute fast and her condition of anuria (absence of urine). After 10 long years of paralysis which she had offered as Eucharistic reparation for the conversion of sinners, on July 30, 1935, Jesus appeared to her saying: “I have put you in the world so that you may draw life only from Me, to bear witness to the world how precious the Eucharist is. [...] “The strongest chain that keeps souls in bondage with Satan is the flesh and the sins of impurity. Never has there been such a spread of vices, wickedness and crimes as there is today! Never has there been so much sin [...] The Eucharist - My Body and Blood - Behold, the Eucharist is the salvation of the world.” Mary also appeared to her on September 12, 1949, with the Rosary in her hand, saying to her “The world is in agony and is dying in sin. My desire is for prayer, my desire is for penance. I have protected with this, my Rosary, all those whom I love and the whole world.” On October 13, 1955, the anniversary of the last apparition of the Blessed Mother at Fatima, Alexandrina was heard exclaiming: “I am happy, for I am on my way to heaven.” She died at 7:30 in the evening on that very day.",

In fact, according to antique traditions, it seems that Mary settled, together with John the Apostle, in this city. The miraculous aspect of the life of Anne Catherine is that for years she fed only on the Eucharist.",
      "text": "Anne Catherine Emmerich was born in Germany on September 8, 1774 into a family of farmers and began to work very early. Later on, a religious vocation matured and she asked to be admitted in several monasteries, but she was always rejected because she was very poor and had no dowry. Only when she was twenty-eight years old she was accepted in the monastery of Agnetenberg, where she joined the monastic life with fervor, always ready to take the most difficult tasks. One night while she was praying, Jesus appeared and offered her a crown of roses and a crown of thorns. She chose the crown of thorns and Jesus put the crown on her head. Suddenly, around her forehead appeared the first stigmata. Later on, after another apparition of Jesus, the wounds also appeared in the hands, feet and side. In 1811, the monastery of Agnetenberg, was suppressed. Anne Catherine found hospitality, as a housekeeper for a priest; but soon she became ill and was bedridden. Dr. Wesner, a young doctor, visited her and remained very impressed by the stigmata. During the eleven years that followed, he became her friend and faithful assistant, having also a diary in which he would transcribe her visions. Meanwhile the nun had practically stopped eating: a little bit of water and the Consecrated Host were enough to keep her alive for years. She was very devoted to, and wrote many pages about, the Holy Eucharist: “My desire for the Holy Eucharist was so vehement and irresistible that, at night, I would often leave my cell to enter the Church... Often I would genuflect and prostrate towards the Blessed Sacrament with extended arms, and sometimes I would enter into ecstasy”. Anne Catherine always joined her suffering with that of Jesus, and offered it for the redemption of men. The most famous biographer of Anne Catherine was the German writer, Clemens von Brentano, who wrote all her visions. Brentano compiled thousands of pages about the Blessed, many of which must still be published. In one of his most famous passages he wrote: “Anne Catherine stands like a cross at the side of the street, to indicate the right direction to the faithful. That which she says is brief but simple, full of depth, warmth and life. I understood everything. Always happy, affectionate, dignified, marvelous; always ill, agonizing, but at the same time delicate and fresh, chaste, tried, lucid. To be seated at her side meant to occupy the most beautiful place in the world”",

The Eucharist is dishonored and nobody cares. My beloved one, you make reparation with your adoration done in my presence.”",

On the day of the wedding in the town hall, Mary’s husband took sick and had to be rushed to the hospital. The doctors diagnosed his ailment as a case of severe tuberculosis. His agony lasted eight months. Notwithstanding that her father had forbidden Mary Grace to visit her husband because the religious ceremony had not yet been celebrated, Mary Grace was often seen at his bedside as she took care of him and taught him catechism. In fact, among her gifts, Mary Grace had the gift of bilocation. As soon as her husband died, Mary Grace embraced the religious life with the Crucified Sisters of Adoration of the Holy Eucharist. One day, as the priest was distributing Communion in the convent chapel, a host escaped from his hand and flew to Mary’s lips. Out of love for the Lord and for sinners she constantly inflicted severe penances on herself. She had a great intimacy with the souls in Purgatory, who sometimes appeared to her to thank her for her prayers. During the last years of her life, Mary Grace hardly ate anything and used to tell her confessor: “I receive such fullness from the Lord when I receive the Blessed Sacrament that in no way can I feel a desire for any food!” She spent many hours in adoration before the tabernacle: she was like a Eucharistic lamp that was burning and shining. Mary’s passionate love had an exceptional recompense: one of the most extraordinary gifts in the history of the mystics, the change of heart. The Lord opened her breast and placed his heart in it. Like all great mystics, Mary was very much tormented by the devil because she tore the souls of sinners from him, so much so that one day, out of spite, the devil went so far as to break her arm. During a vision she experienced the terrifying pains of the crucifixion and Jesus himself pierced her heart with a lance. It was the wound of love, which bound her definitively to her Spouse. From that moment on, Mary of the Passion carried the stigmata until her death. During the last fifteen days of her life, she lived on the Eucharist alone.",

Since his youth, he was greatly involved in natural science studies - to the point of being considered among the founding fathers of geology, paleontology and crystallography. His prolific scientific activity caused him to travel all over Europe. On June 24, 1666, in Livorno, Italy, Nicholas Steno received the grace of conversion to the Catholic faith. His biographers wrote, “He observed with curiosity and perplexity the procession for the Feast of Corpus Christi and the fervor around it. The large Piazza d’Armi was bursting with colors and sounds. A loud, prolonged ringing of bells could be heard. The young man was recalling another procession he watched three years before in Lovanio, Belgium, where many students were lined up and dozens of black-robed professors were walking. He could perceive something different here. Maybe it was a sense of joy, a new warm feeling… or maybe his eyes had changed? Long lines of men in white tunics were processing and singing. Gonfalons and banners were swinging in the gentle breeze coming from the sea. Friars and priests were processing too, dressed in their white surplices adorned with laces and fringes. Even more priests were part of the procession, wearing their copes shining in the sun, and children holding incense burners. Finally, a big golden canopy passed by, and under it a minister of the Church, solemnly dressed, absorbed in his thoughts, carrying close to his chest the precious monstrance with the Sacred Host…. “People knelt as the Blessed Sacrament passed by and eyes were sparkling with love as they gazed upon the Host, all heads bowed down in adoration. Petals and flowers were showering from all corners. The young Nicholas Steno spent the whole day with a deep uneasiness in his heart. He remembered the Jesuit priest in Paris with whom he had discussed the Real Presence of Jesus in the consecrated Bread. The Jesuit priest had emphasized the value of Jesus’ words at the Last Supper, ‘This is my Body’, and then St. Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians. That day Nicholas Steno decided to convert to Catholicism. He immediately entered the seminary, and after nine years of study he was ordained a priest. He described his conversion: ‘As soon as I attentively pondered God’s favors to me, these appeared to be so many that I couldn’t help but offer to Him the best of myself and in the best way, from the bottom of my heart… Therefore, having come to know the great dignity of priesthood… I asked and obtained that I may offer the Immaculate Host to the Eternal Father for my good and the good of others.’”",

All his requests were granted. He lived for twenty years in the forest as a hermit with no food except for the Eucharist, as many witnesses testified.",

A woman who perhaps was the most unusual, most extraordinary and disconcerting of our age, but whom even in the age of television remained unknown to the public, buried in a profound silence… From our first meeting, I understood that Marthe Robin would have been a ‘sister of charity,’ always, as she was for thousands of visitors.”",
      "text": "Marthe Robin was born on March 13, 1902, in Châteauneuf-de-Galaure (Drôme), in France, to a family of peasants, and she spent her entire life in her parents’ home, where she died February 6, 1981. Marthe’s entire existence revolved around the Eucharist, which for her was “the one thing that cures, comforts, lifts, blesses, my Everything.” In 1928, after a serious neurological illness, Marthe found it almost impossible to move, especially to swallow because those muscles were affected. Moreover, due to an eye illness, she was forced to live in almost absolute darkness. According to her spiritual director, Father Don Finet: “When she received the stigmata, in early October 1930, Marthe had already lived with the pains of the Passion since 1925, the year in which she offered herself as a victim of love. That day, Jesus said she was chosen, like the Virgin, to live the Passion more intensely. No one else would experience it so completely. Every day she has endured more pain, and at night she does not sleep. After the stigmata, Marthe was not able to drink or eat. The ecstasy lasted until Monday or Tuesday.” Marthe Robin accepted all the sufferings for love of Jesus the Redeemer and the sinners He wanted to save. The great philosopher Jean Guitton, recalling his meeting with the visionary, wrote: “I found myself in that dark room of hers, confronted by the best-known contemporary critics of the Church: Novelist Anatole France (a critic whose books were condemned by the Vatican) and Dr. Paul-Louis Couchoud, a disciple of Alfred Loisy (an excommunicated priest whose books were condemned by the Vatican) and author of a number of books denying the historical reality of Jesus. From our first meeting, I understood that Marthe Robin would have been a ‘sister of charity’ always, as she was for thousands of visitors.” In fact, beyond the extraordinary mystical phenomena, extremely significant was the work of evangelization that Marthe managed to accomplish, despite her condition, thanks to the help of Father Finet, with whom she founded sixty “Foyers of Charity” groups (centers or homes of light, charity and love) throughout the world.",

I was standing by the door, looking around with my eyes for my friend, but did not succeed in finding him... “My gaze passed from the shadows to the light...from the faithful gathered there, to the nuns, to the altar...and came to rest above the second candle burning to the left of the Cross (unaware that I was standing in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament). And at that point, suddenly a series of miracles unfolded whose indescribable force shattered in an instant the absurd being that I was, to bring to birth the amazed child that I had never been... At first the hint of these words, ‘Spiritual Life’ came to me... as if they had been pronounced in a whisper next to me... then came a great light... a world, another world of a radiance and a destiny that in one stroke cast our world among the fragile shadows of unfulfilled dreams... of which I felt all the sweetness... a sweetness that was active and upsetting beyond every form of violence, capable of breaking the hardest stone and that which is even harder than stone - the human heart. Its overflowing eruption, so complete, was accompanied by a joy which is the exultation of the saved, the joy of the shipwrecked who is picked up just in time. These sensations, which I find difficult to translate into a language which cannot capture these ideas and images, were all simultaneous... Everything is dominated by the Presence… of Him of Whom I would never be able to write His name without fear of harming its tenderness, of Him before Whom I have had the good fortune to be a forgiven child who wakes up to discover that everything is a gift… God existed and was present... one thing only surprised me: The Eucharist! Not that it seemed incredible, but it amazed me that Divine Charity would have come upon this silent way to communicate Himself, and above all that He would choose to become bread, which is the staple of the poor, and the food preferred by children… O Divine Love, eternity will be too short to speak of You.”",

About a year later, she received the stigmata and began fasting, which lasted 36 years until her death.

Hitler was very fearful of Teresa.",
      "text": "Teresa Neumann was born in Konnersreuth Germany, on April 8th, 1898 from an extremely poor Catholic family. Her greatest ambition was to become a missionary in Africa but that was not possible as she was a victim of an accident at the age of 20 when a horrible fire broke out in a nearby plant and Teresa went to help and in the process of passing buckets of water to stop the flames, she got a horrible lesion in her spinal cord that caused a paralysis in both her legs and complete blindness. Teresa then passed her days in prayer, but one day her miraculous recovery occurred in the presence of Father Naber who wrote: “Teresa described a vision of a great light and an extraordinary, sweet voice that was asking her if she wished to be healed. Teresa gave the most surprising answer when she replied that to her it would not make any difference whether she would be healed, stay the way she was or even die, as long as it was the will of God. The mysterious voice told her that ‘that very day she would receive a small joy; the healing of her infirmities, but that she would still have a lot of suffering to endure in her future.’” For a little while, Teresa lived in fairly good health, but in 1926 her most important mystical experiences started and lasted until the day she died. She received the stigmata, and she began a complete fasting, with the Eucharist as her only nourishment. Father Naber, who administered Communion to Teresa every day, wrote: “In her, God’s promised word is accomplished: ‘My Flesh is real food and my Blood is a true drink’”. Teresa offered the Lord her physical suffering - due to the loss of blood caused by the stigmata - that started every Thursday during the day when Jesus’ Passion started, until Sunday, His Resurrection. This suffering was offered, through her intercession, for sinners that asked for help. Every time she would be called to a person’s death bed, she would be witness to that soul’s judgment, as it is usual to happen right after death. Ecclesiastical authorities performed many examinations in regard to Teresa’s continuous fasting. Carl Strater, S.J., directed by the Bishop of Ratisbonne, studied and examined the life of the stigmatized Teresa and confirmed: “The significance of Teresa Neumann’s fasting is to show the people of the world the value of the Holy Eucharist, to make the world understand that Christ is actually present in the bread of the Eucharist and that through the Holy Eucharist, physical life can actually be preserved.”",

A great miracle came upon him, which was immediately recognized and approved by the Archbishop of Zaragoza who presided over the canonical process. In his clear judgment he wrote that “Miguel-Juan Pellicer of Calanda was miraculously given back his right leg, which was amputated years prior and it was not a natural occurrence but a miraculous one”.",
      "text": "Miguel-Juan Pellicer was born in 1617 to a poor family of farmers in Calanda, a village about 100 kilometers from Zaragoza. At 19 years of age, he decided to go to work for an uncle near Castellon de la Plata. One day, while working in the fields, he fell under a wagon full of grain and the wheels fractured his right leg. Miguel-Juan was immediately taken to the local hospital in Valencia. Realizing that it would be impossible for the doctors to cure him, he decided to discharge himself and begin a 13-kilometer trip towards Zaragoza to ask the Madonna of Pilar for help. He walked with crutches, leaning the knee of the fractured and now infected leg on a piece of wood. He reached Zaragoza in October 1637, waning and feverish. He dragged himself to the Sanctuary of Pilar where he made his confession and received the Holy Eucharist. He was immediately sent to recover at Royal Hospital of Grace. Given the status of his gangrene, the doctors established that the only way to save his life was to amputate his leg, so the limb was cut off with a saw and scalpel slightly below the knee and cauterized with red hot metal. A young practitioner, Juan Lorenzo Garcia, took the amputated limb and buried it in the cemetery next to the hospital. From that moment, Miguel-Juan was forced to beg for his livelihood near the Sanctuary of the Virgin of Pilar. Every morning he went to Mass and prayed with fervor before the Holy Sacrament. It was customary for him to rub his mutilated leg with oil from the tabernacle lamp. After three years away from home, he decided to return to his family, who lovingly welcomed him back. In March of 1640, after a vigil in honor of the Virgin, Miguel-Juan, feeling very tired, went to rest in his customary spot and as usual rubbed his leg with oil from the tabernacle lamp in the Sanctuary of the Madonna of Pilar. When his mother went to check to see if her son was okay, she saw him sleeping, and discovered that from beneath the blanket stuck out not one, but two feet. Miguel-Juan had miraculously recovered his lost limb, which was buried three years prior by the practitioner Mr. Garcia. According to the eyewitnesses present and the canonic process, “the leg was pale, smaller in size and muscular mass, but perfectly vital and allowed him to walk.”",

I ask pardon for those who do not believe, do not adore, do not hope, and do not love You. Pray in this way. The hearts of Jesus and Mary are attentive to your prayers.’ And he disappeared. The supernatural atmosphere that he left us in was so intense we were for a long time unaware of our own existence...”. Second Apparition of the Angel “The angel said to us: ‘What are you doing? You must pray! Pray a lot! The hearts of Jesus and Mary have merciful designs for you. You must constantly offer your prayers and sacrifices to God, the Most High.’ ‘How are we to sacrifice?’ I asked. ‘In every possible way offer sacrifice to God in reparation for the sins by which He is offended, and in supplication for the conversion of sinners. In this way you will bring peace to your country. I am the Guardian Angel of Portugal. Above all, bear and accept with submission the sufferings God will send you.’ And he disappeared... These words of the angel cut into our spirits like a light, making us understand who God is, how He loves us, and how He wants us to love Him; the value of sacrifice and how it pleases Him; how He receives it for the conversion of sinners.” Third Apparition of the Angel “We saw the angel holding in his left hand a chalice, and suspended in the air above it was a Host from which drops of Blood fell into the chalice. Leaving the chalice and the Host suspended in the air, he knelt near us and repeated three times the prayer: ‘Most Holy Trinity, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, I adore You profoundly, and I offer You the Most Precious Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity of Jesus Christ, present in all the tabernacles of the world, in reparation for the outrages, sacrileges and indifferences by which He is offended. And by the infinite merits of His Most Sacred Heart and the Immaculate Heart of Mary, I beg the conversion of poor sinners.’ After that he rose and took again in his hands the chalice and the Host. The Host he gave to me and the contents of the chalice he gave to Jacinta and Francesco, saying at the same time, ‘Eat and drink the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ, terribly outraged by the ingratitude of men. Offer reparation for their sakes and console God.’ ...and then he disappeared.”",

Then she asked him to go to the top of the hill and collect and bring her any flowers that he could find. Juan Diego went to the place she told him and found it covered with marvelous roses and other flowers, unusual for the winter season and the arid nature of the land. He picked them and put them in his tilma, a typical apron worn by the Aztec farmers, and he took them to the Virgin who told him to take the flowers to the bishop as proof of the apparition. The man did as he was asked and went to Mexico City where, after a long wait, he was seen by the prelate. He showed him the tilma and when he spread it out the roses and other flowers fell and on it appeared a blazing image of the Madonna. The Bishop fell to his knees before this miracle. He marveled, and repenting he asked the Virgin to forgive him for his defiance. Then he took the tilma and put it in a chapel.

Her hands, raised to waist level in a natural position, held another small golden globe with a gold Cross on top. Her eyes looked beseechingly towards Heaven. While I was intent on contemplating her, the Holy Virgin lowered her eyes towards me and said these words: ‘This globe that you see represents the entire world, in particular France, and every single person.’ And the Virgin added, ‘The rays symbolize the graces shed on those who petition me’, making me understand how sweet it is to pray to the Holy Virgin and how generous she is to those who invoke her. And then an oval frame formed around the figure of the Holy Virgin, with a semi-circular border of writing in gold above the right hand of Mary spelling out: ‘OH MARY, CONCEIVED WITHOUT SIN, PRAY FOR US WHO HAVE RECOURSE TO THEE’. “At this point in the vision, the globe that Mary had offered to God disappeared; her hands, full of graces, faced the globe that she rested her feet upon, stepping on a green serpent with yellow spots. Suddenly the frame flipped and I saw the back of the medal showing the letter ‘M’ for Mary, and the Cross, and below the monogram there were two hearts; that of Jesus with the crown of thorns and that of Mary pierced by a sword. Around it, like a frame, there was a regal crown of twelve little stars. “Then I heard a voice saying to me, ‘Coin a medal in this style. All those who carry this will receive graces, especially if they wear the blessed medal around their neck and recite this short prayer. They will receive special protection from the Mother of God and will receive great graces. The graces will be abundant for those who wear it with great faith.’”",

When the priest was breaking the large Host in half to place a small Fragment in the chalice, this very Part escaped his hand and flew into the air, radiating light, and came to rest on the tongue of the future saint. Today, the shrine where the miracle took place is under the care of the devout Filipini Sisters.",

In the last days of her life, a stomach ailment which had afflicted her for a long time, as it became more acute, prevented her from receiving Communion. Before her death in 1341, she asked that a consecrated Host be placed on her chest, and as she recited a prayer, the Host disappeared and left a violet mark, as if the mark had been branded there. She was beatified in 1678 and canonized in 1737.",
